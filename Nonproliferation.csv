R\&D EFFORTS FOCUS ON ACTIVE INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES, EMPLOYING EXTERNAL BEAMS OF NEUTRONS OR HIGH-ENERGY X-RAYS TO FIRST TRIGGER FISSION REACTIONS AND THEN DETECT PROMPT OR DELAYED NEUTRONS AND/OR PHOTONS. OUR GROUP CREATED AN ACTIVE INTERROGATION SYSTEM BASED ON DETECTORS DEVELOPED BY YALE UNIVERSITY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF PISA. THESE DETECTORS CONTAIN LIQUID DROPLETS THAT VAPORIZE WHEN EXPOSED TO FAST NEUTRONS, BUT ARE INSENSITIVE TO X-RAYS. THE SYSTEM WAS TESTED WITH AN X-RAY GENERATOR BASED ON A 9 MEV ELECTRON LINAC AVAILABLE AT AN ACTIVE INTERROGATION FACILITY. COPPER IS USED AS AN X-RAY PRODUCTION TARGET AT THIS FACILITY, WHICH PREVENTS THE PRODUCTION OF PHOTO-NEUTRONS. WITH THIS SYSTEM, WE DETECTED A SAMPLE OF NATURAL URANIUM EITHER UNCOVERED OR SHIELDED UNDER HEAVY LOADS OF WOOD OR STEEL PIPES. IN ORDER TO INTERPRET THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS, THE RESPONSE OF OUR DETECTOR SYSTEMS WAS ASSESSED USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS WITH THE CODE PHITS. COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL ONES AND OPEN THE WAY TO SIMULATIONS OF REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS OF INTEREST TO NONPROLIFERATION AND HOMELAND SECURITY, NAMELY ACTIVE INTERROGATION AT A STANDOFF.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","YALE UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITY OF PISA; ISTITUTO NAZIONALE DI FISICA NUCLEARE (INFN)","995","ANDERSON.KS.ALVES@GMAIL.COM","2022-11-29","WB3ZO","10.1140/epjp/s13360-021-01971-2",NA,NA,"DHS GRANT [2016-DN-077-ARI107]","THIS RESEARCH WAS SUPPORTED IN PART BY DHS GRANT 2016-DN-077-ARI107.","2190-5444","EUR.

THE UNITED STATES, HOWEVER, HAS BOTH PROMOTED THE MULTILATERAL IMPLEMENTATION OF STRATEGIC TRADE CONTROLS BUT HAS ALSO INCREASINGLY RESORTED TO EXTRATERRITORIAL ENFORCEMENT OF ITS COUNTERPROLIFERATION RULES.

MODELING TECHNIQUES EXPLORED INCLUDE ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION (OLS), PRINCIPAL COMPONENT REGRESSION (PCR), AND PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION (PLS). MULTIPLE PCR AND PLS MODELS WERE BUILT BASED ON DIFFERENT VARIABLE SELECTION METHODS, SUCH AS CROSS VALIDATION AND AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERIA. THE OLS MODEL PREDICTIONS HAVE A ROOT MEAN SQUARE PERCENT ERROR (RMSPE) OF LESS THAN 10\%, BUT THE MODELS ARE VERY UNSTABLE.

THE OFTEN-USED HELIUM-3 (HE-3) NEUTRON DETECTOR IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN DUE TO HE-3 SHORTAGES. AS AN EMERGING OXIDE SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIAL, GA2O3 EXHIBITS EXCELLENT PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. THESE PHYSICAL MERITS ENABLE GA2O3'S POTENTIAL AS A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SEMICONDUCTOR NEUTRON DETECTOR FOR EXTREME CONDITION APPLICATIONS. HERE, TWO APPROACHES ARE EXPLORED, I.E., APPLYING AN EXTERIOR CONVERSION LAYER OF BORON-10 (B-10) ON GA2O3 AND DIRECTLY DOPING B-10 INTO GA2O3 TO DEMONSTRATE GA2O3'S CAPABILITY FOR NEUTRON DETECTION. USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATION, WE SHOW THE DISTINCT DIFFERENCE IN NEUTRON DETECTION EFFICIENCY OF GA2O3 WHEN APPLYING DIRECT DOPING OF B-10 INTO GA2O3 VS APPLYING A UNIFORM B-10 CONVERSION LAYER ON TOP OF GA2O3. OUR RESULTS EXHIBIT THAT THE THEORETICALLY PREDICTED MAXIMUM DOPING LEVEL OF B-10 IN GA2O3 DOES NOT LEAD TO THE SAME DETECTION EFFICIENCY AS THAT OF A SIMPLE B-10 CONVERSION LAYER WHEN DETECTING 480KEV GAMMAS. EXCEPT FOR THE MOST THERMALIZED NEUTRONS AT 0.01EV, DIRECT DOPING SIMULATIONS ARE NOT ABLE TO ACHIEVE COMPARABLE RESULTS TO THAT OF THE CONVERSION LAYER METHOD.","1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA","UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA; NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY","155706","GYANG9@NCSU.EDU","2022-11-29","OM1RX","10.1063/5.0015522",NA,"1089-7550",NA,NA,"0021-8979","J.

THE PAD'S SIGNALS ARE USED TO MEASURE X-Y COORDINATES WHILE THE CATHODE SIGNALS GIVE THE INTERACTION DEPTHS (Z COORDINATES). COMBINED TOGETHER THE SIGNALS PROVIDE 3D POSITION INFORMATION OF THE INTERACTION POINTS WHICH CAN BE USED TO CORRECT THE DETECTOR RESPONSE NON-UNIFORMITY. THIS ALLOWS DEVELOPERS TO USE STANDARD GRADE (UNSELECTED) CZT CRYSTALS WHILE RETAINING HIGH SPECTROSCOPIC PERFORMANCE COMPARABLE WITH THAT OF THE H3D PIXELATED DETECTORS. THE ARRAY'S DESIGN PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY TO REPLACE INDIVIDUAL DETECTORS AND EXTEND THEIR SIZES, POTENTIALLY INCREASING UPWARDS OF 4 CM IN HEIGHT.

THESE TWO INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS, EACH AIMING TO MANAGE NUCLEAR POSSESSION AND REDUCE THE RISK OF NUCLEAR USE, ARE AT ONCE COMPLIMENTARY AND CONTRADICTORY. WHILE TENSIONS BETWEEN THESE SYSTEMS ARE NOT NEW, THE WAR IN UKRAINE EXACERBATES THEM IN UNPRECEDENTED WAYS. THE SYSTEM OF NUCLEAR DETERRENCE SEEMS TO BE PROVING ITS WORTH BY INDUCING RESTRAINT ON RUSSIA AND NATO, WHILE THE SYSTEM OF RESTRAINT IS UNDERMINED BY DEMONSTRATING WHAT HAPPENS TO A COUNTRY NOT PROTECTED BY NUCLEAR DETERRENCE. THE LATTER LESSON IS PARTICULARLY VIVID GIVEN UKRAINE'S DECISION TO FORGO A NUCLEAR OPTION IN 1994 IN EXCHANGE FOR SECURITY ASSURANCES FROM NUCLEAR POWERS. RUSSIA'S USE OF NUCLEAR THREATS AS AN ENABLER FOR ESCALATION AND THE SPECTER OF RUSSIAN TACTICAL NUCLEAR USE AGAINST UKRAINE GOES WELL BEYOND ITS DECLARED NUCLEAR DOCTRINE.

HOWEVER, THE CHALLENGING OF A HEGEMON'S AUTHORITY-AS OCCURRED ON 9/11-GENERATES A NEED TO ASSERT HEGEMONY AND DEMONSTRATE STRENGTH TO A GLOBAL AUDIENCE. ONLY FIGHTING A WAR CAN DEMONSTRATE SUCH STRENGTH; NO PEACEFUL BARGAIN, EVEN A LOPSIDED ONE, CAN ACHIEVE THE SAME EFFECT.

PRE-EXISTING EXPORT CONTROLS FOCUS ON GENERAL CONCEPTS AND PROCESSES AND DO NOT CONSIDER SPECIFIC NUANCES OF VARIOUS TECHNIQUES THAT ARE CATEGORIZED AS ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING.

WHAT DOES THIS RELATIONSHIP TELL US ABOUT HOW GOVERNMENTS REACT TO VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL RULES? IN CONTRAST TO THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT TRANSPARENT MONITORING STRENGTHENS THE NORMATIVE LEGAL ORDER, WE ARGUE THAT THESE ACTIVITIES OFTEN UNDERMINE IT. WE DEVELOP TWO MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH THIS OCCURS: BY RAISING THE KNOWN RATE OF NONCOMPLIANCE, AND BY SHARPENING THE THREAT THAT DEVIANCE POSES TO OTHER STATES. WE ARGUE THAT WHEN ENFORCERS UNDERSTAND THE DANGERS OF PUBLICIZING TRANSGRESSIONS, THEY DO SO SELECTIVELY. FOCUSING ON THE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION DOMAIN, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THESE CONCERNS SHAPED AMERICAN DECISIONS TO REVEAL OR OBFUSCATE OTHER STATES' EFFORTS TO OBTAIN NUCLEAR WEAPONS. WE FORMALIZE THIS ARGUMENT AND THEN EMPIRICALLY TEST THE MODEL'S PREDICTIONS USING IN-DEPTH CASE STUDY ANALYSES. WE FIND THAT THE US FAILED TO DISCLOSE INFRACTIONS WHEN THIS PUBLICITY WOULD HAVE UNDERMINED THE RULES THROUGH THE TWO MECHANISMS WE IDENTIFY. HOWEVER, WHILE CONCEALING VIOLATIONS CAN PREVENT PROLIFERATION IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC NUCLEAR PROGRAMS, IT CAN ALSO CREATE POTENTIAL DANGERS TO A REGIME'S OVERALL HEALTH AND STABILITY.

THE USE OF COSMIC RAY MUONS IN NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION AND SAFEGUARD VERIFICATION APPLICATIONS HAS RECENTLY GAINED ATTENTION DUE TO THE NON-INTRUSIVE AND PASSIVE NATURE OF THE INSPECTION, PENETRATING CAPABILITIES, AS WELL AS RECENT ADVANCES IN DETECTORS THAT MEASURE POSITION AND DIRECTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL MUONS BEFORE AND AFTER TRAVERSING THE IMAGED OBJECT. HOWEVER, MUON IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES ARE LIMITED IN RESOLUTION DUE TO LOW MUON FLUX AND THE EFFECTS OF MULTIPLE COULOMB SCATTERING (MCS). CURRENT RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS, E.G., POINT OF CLOSEST APPROACH (POCA) OR STRAIGHT-LINE PATH (SLP), RELY ON OVERLY SIMPLE ASSUMPTIONS FOR MUON PATH ESTIMATION THROUGH THE IMAGED OBJECT. FOR ROBUST MUON TOMOGRAPHY, EFFICIENT AND FLEXIBLE PHYSICS-BASED ALGORITHMS ARE NEEDED TO MODEL THE MCS PROCESS AND ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE MOST PROBABLE TRAJECTORY OF A MUON AS IT TRAVERSES AN OBJECT. IN THE PRESENT WORK, THE USE OF A BAYESIAN FRAMEWORK AND A GAUSSIAN APPROXIMATION OF MCS IS EXPLORED FOR ESTIMATION OF THE MOST LIKELY PATH OF A COSMIC RAY MUON TRAVERSING UNIFORM OR NONUNIFORM MEDIA AND UNDERGOING MCS. THE ALGORITHM'S PRECISION IS COMPARED TO MONTE CARLO SIMULATED MUON TRAJECTORIES. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE ALGORITHM IS EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO PREDICT MUON TRACKS TO LESS THAN 1.5MM ROOT MEAN SQUARE (RMS) FOR 0.5 GEV MUONS AND 0.25MM RMS FOR 3 GEV MUONS, A 50\% IMPROVEMENT COMPARED TO SLP AND 15\% IMPROVEMENT WHEN COMPARED TO POCA. FURTHER, A 30\% INCREASE IN USEFUL MUON FLUX WAS OBSERVED RELATIVE TO POCA. MUON TRACK PREDICTION IMPROVED FOR HIGHER MUON ENERGIES OR SMALLER PENETRATION DEPTH WHERE ENERGY LOSS IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE EFFECT OF ENERGY LOSS DUE TO IONIZATION IS INVESTIGATED, AND A LINEAR ENERGY LOSS RELATION THAT IS EASY TO USE IS PROPOSED.

ROOM TEMPERATURE HYDROLYSIS OF UF4 WAS INVESTIGATED USING A COMBINATION OF FLUORINE-19 NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY (F-19 NMR), RAMAN AND INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY, POWDER X-RAY DIFFRACTION, AND MICROSCOPY MEASUREMENTS. UF4(H2O)(2.5) WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE PRIMARY SOLID HYDROLYSIS PRODUCT WHEN ANHYDROUS UF4 WAS STIRRED IN DEIONIZED WATER. STATIC NMR AND F-19 MAGIC ANGLE SPINNING NMR MEASUREMENTS REVEALED THAT A SMALL AMOUNT OF URANYL FLUORIDE CAN ALSO FORM WHEN ANHYDROUS UF4 IS LEFT IN WATER, ALTHOUGH THIS SPECIES COMPRISES LESS THAN 5\% OF THE TOTAL SAMPLE WITH THE REMAINING PARTS BEING UF4(H2O)(2.5). SINCE UF4 IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE STABLE UNDER AMBIENT CONDITIONS, THESE FINDINGS MARK THE FIRST TIME THAT A ROOM TEMPERATURE REACTION BETWEEN UF4 AND WATER HAS BEEN DETECTED AND ANALYZED WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM ADDITIONAL CHEMICAL REAGENTS. THE RAMAN CHARACTERIZATION OF UF4(H2O)(2.5) PRESENTED HEREIN IS THE FIRST ON RECORD. SINCE UF4 IS ONE OF THE MOST USED INTERMEDIATES DURING CHEMICAL CONVERSION OF URANIUM ORE TO URANIUM METAL FOR NUCLEAR FUEL AND WEAPONS, THE RESULTS PRESENTED HEREIN ARE APPLICABLE TO NUMEROUS NUCLEAR SCIENCE FIELDS WHERE SOLID STATE DETECTION OF URANIUM IS OF VALUE, INCLUDING NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION, NUCLEAR FORENSICS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION.","THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); SAVANNAH RIVER NATIONAL LABORATORY; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE; UNITED STATES NAVY; NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY",NA,"CHRISTOPHER.KLUG@NRI.NAVY.MIL MATTHEW.WELLONS@SRNL.DOE.GOV","2022-11-29","QK9VV","10.1039/d0dt03944f",NA,"1477-9234","LABORATORY DIRECTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (LDRD) PROGRAM WITHIN THE SAVANNAH RIVER NATIONAL LABORATORY (SRNL); U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE) OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT (EM) [DE-AC09-08SR22470]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE LABORATORY DIRECTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (LDRD) PROGRAM WITHIN THE SAVANNAH RIVER NATIONAL LABORATORY (SRNL).

DESPITE THE LONGSTANDING UTILITY OF THIS PROCESS, THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURES OF STARTING MATERIALS AND INTERMEDIATES PRODUCED DURING THIS THERMAL CONVERSION REMAIN ILL-DEFINED. TO HELP RESOLVE THIS UNCERTAINTY, WE MEASURED HIGH-RESOLUTION RAMAN AND INFRARED SPECTRA OF PU(C2O4)(2)CENTER DOT 6H(2)O THAT WAS HEATED TO 25, 100, 220, 250, 350, AND 450 DEGREES C IN AIR. OUR MEASUREMENTS SHOW THAT PU(C2O4)(2)CENTER DOT 6H(2)O HAS A RICH VIBRATIONAL SPECTRUM WITH AT LEAST 15 RAMAN BANDS BETWEEN 180 CM(-1) AND 1900 CM(-1) AND 9 INFRARED BANDS BETWEEN 800 CM(-1) AND 4000 CM(-1). AS PU(C2O4)(2)CENTER DOT 6H(2)O IS HEATED, WATER IS LIBERATED, AND THE OXALATE LIGAND DECOMPOSES TO PRODUCE PLUTONIUM OXYCARBIDE SPECIES. WHEN HEATED TO 350 DEGREES C OR HIGHER, VIBRATIONAL SPECTRA ARE CONSISTENT WITH PUO2 WITH SOME RESIDUAL CARBON-CONTAINING SPECIES.

THESE DATA CAN BE USED TO VALIDATE AND POTENTIALLY IMPROVE EXISTING COMPUTATIONAL MODELS THAT DESCRIBE THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE OF COMPOUNDS PRODUCED DURING THERMAL DEGRADATION OF PLUTONIUM (IV) OXALATE.

COLOR CENTERS CAN BE READ OUT OPTICALLY AND WE PROPOSE A SCHEME BASED ON SELECTIVE PLANE ILLUMINATION MICROSCOPY FOR MICROMETER-SCALE IMAGING OF LARGE VOLUMES CORRESPONDING TO KILOGRAM MASS DETECTORS. THIS CLASS OF DETECTORS WOULD BE PASSIVE AND WOULD OPERATE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND WE CALL THIS THE PASSIVE LOWENERGY OPTICAL COLOR-CENTER NUCLEAR-RECOIL (PALEOCCENE) DETECTION METHOD. WE APPLY THESE CONCEPTS TO THE DETECTION OF REACTOR NEUTRINOS USING COHERENT ELASTIC NEUTRINO NUCLEUS SCATTERING (CEVNS). CRYSTALDAMAGE FORMATION ENERGIES ARE INTRINSICALLY ON THE ORDER OF 25 EV, RESULTING IN SIMILARLY LOW NUCLEAR-RECOIL THRESHOLDS. THIS WOULD ENABLE THE OBSERVATION OF REACTOR-NEUTRINO CEVNS WITH DETECTORS AS SMALL AS 10 G. ADDITIONALLY, A COMPETITIVE SEARCH FOR SPIN-DEPENDENT DARK-MATTER SCATTERING DOWN TO A DARK-MATTER MASS OF 0.3 GEV COULD BE POSSIBLE. PASSIVE CRYSTAL DETECTORS MIGHT ALSO BE ATTRACTIVE FOR NUCLEAR-NONPROLIFERATION SAFEGUARDS IF USED TO MONITOR REACTOR POWER AND TO PUT LIMITS ON PLUTONIUM PRODUCTION. THE PASSIVE NATURE AND SMALL FOOTPRINT OF THE PROPOSED DETECTORS IMPLIES THAT THESE MIGHT FIT WELL WITHIN ACCEPTED REACTORSAFEGUARDS OPERATIONS.","ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA","VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE \& STATE UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON; UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SEATTLE; UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON; UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SEATTLE","064060","BKCOGSWELL@VT.EDU GOELAPURVAL@GMAIL.COM PAHUBER@VT.EDU","2022-11-29","XY9GY","10.1103/PhysRevApplied.16.064060",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2331-7019","PHYS.

SOON THEREAFTER, THE TWO SUPERPOWERS WORKED TOGETHER TO CREATE THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY (IAEA) TO PLACE SAFEGUARDS ON NUCLEAR ASSISTANCE AND EVENTUALLY ADDED OTHER NONPROLIFERATION MEASURES. WHAT EXPLAINS THESE DECISIONS? WE ARGUE THAT AN INTERNATIONAL HIERARCHY FRAMEWORK OFFERS A ROBUST EXPLANATION FOR THE SUPERPOWERS' BEHAVIOR. WE IDENTIFY THREE DISTINCT MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH RIVAL HIERARCHIES CAN INFLUENCE THE INTERNAL WORKINGS OF ONE ANOTHER: COMPETITIVE SHAMING, OUTBIDDING, AND INTERHIERARCHY COOPERATION. WE THEN PROBE THE PLAUSIBILITY OF OUR ARGUMENT BY INVESTIGATING MULTIPLE OBSERVABLE IMPLICATIONS IN OUR CASE STUDY OF NUCLEAR POLITICS.

THE CURATED LISTS ARE AVAILABLE AS WEB TABLES AT THE COSTANZI RESEARCH WEBSITE (HTTPS://COSTANZIRESEARCH.COM/CW-CONTROL-LISTS/). THE ANNOTATIONS INCLUDE MANUALLY CURATED 2D STRUCTURAL IMAGES, WHICH PROVIDE A MEANS TO APPRECIATE AT A GLANCE THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DIFFERENT ENTRIES, AS WELL AS DOWNLOADABLE 2D STRUCTURES, IN TWO DIFFERENT FORMATS AND THREE DIFFERENT STRUCTURAL IDENTIFIERS, NAMELY, SIMPLIFIED MOLECULAR-INPUT LINE-ENTRY SYSTEM, STANDARD INCHI, AND STANDARD INCHIKEY, WHICH ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE A PLATFORM FOR CHEMINFORMATICS ANALYSES. THE TABLES ALSO INCLUDE LINKS TO NATIONAL CENTER FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY INFORMATION'S PUBCHEM AND NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY'S CHEMISTRY WEBBOOK CARDS, HENCE PROVIDING PROMPT ACCESS TO A WEALTH OF PHYSICOCHEMICAL, ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY, AND TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION. TO SHOWCASE THE IMPORTANCE OF STRUCTURAL ANNOTATIONS, WE DISCUSS A DISCREPANCY IN A CW-CONTROL LIST COVERING THE DEFOLIANT AGENT ORANGE, WHICH WE IDENTIFIED THROUGH OUR CURATION PROCESS, AND PROPOSE A SOLUTION TO ADDRESS IT. MOREOVER, WE PRESENT THE RESULTS OF CHEMICAL FINGERPRINTING ANALYSES, THROUGH WHICH WE CLUSTERED THE ENTRIES OF THE THREE CW-CONTROL LISTS UNDER STUDY INTO STRUCTURALLY RELATED GROUPS AND STUDIED THE OVERLAPS BETWEEN THE THREE LISTS. AS AN APPLICATION OF THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINE THE RECENT UPDATES OF CWC SCHEDULE 1 AND THE AG PRECURSORS LIST, HIGHLIGHTING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE TWO AMENDMENTS AND PROPOSING THE POSSIBLE ADDITION OF FURTHER CHEMICALS. OUR RESEARCH IS INTENDED TO FACILITATE THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC ADVISORS AND POLICYMAKERS AS WELL AS THE WORK OF CHEMISTS AND CHEMINFORMATICIANS INVOLVED IN THE CW NONPROLIFERATION FIELD.

THESE FRAMEWORKS FEATURE LISTS OF CHEMICALS THAT CAN BE USED AS CHEMICAL WEAPONS OR PRECURSORS FOR THEIR SYNTHESIS (CW-CONTROL LISTS). IN THESE LISTS, CHEMICALS OF CONCERN ARE DESCRIBED THROUGH CHEMICAL NAMES AND CAS REGISTRY NUMBERS(R). IMPORTANTLY, IN SOME CW-CONTROL LISTS, SOME ENTRIES, RATHER THAN SPECIFYING INDIVIDUAL CHEMICALS, DESCRIBE FAMILIES OF RELATED CHEMICALS. WORKING WITH CW-CONTROL LISTS POSES CHALLENGES FOR FRONTLINE CUSTOMS AND EXPORT CONTROL OFFICERS IMPLEMENTING THESE FRAMEWORKS. ENTRIES THAT DESCRIBE FAMILIES OF CHEMICALS ARE NOT EASY TO INTERPRET, ESPECIALLY FOR NON-CHEMISTS. MOREOVER, SYNONYMS AND CHEMICAL VARIANTS COMPLICATE THE ISSUE OF CHECKING CW-CONTROL LISTS THROUGH NAMES AND REGISTRY NUMBERS. TO AMELIORATE THESE PROBLEMS, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A FUNCTIONING PROTOTYPE OF A CHEMINFORMATICS TOOL THAT AUTOMATES THE TASK OF ASSESSING WHETHER A CHEMICAL IS PART OF A CW-CONTROL LIST. THE TOOL, DUBBED THE NONPROLIFERATION CHEMINFORMATICS COMPLIANCE TOOL (NCCT), IS A DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (BASED ON CHEMAXON'S INSTANT JCHEM) WITH AN EMBEDDED DATABASE OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES. THE KEY FEATURE OF THE DATABASE IS THAT IT CONTAINS NOT ONLY THE STRUCTURES OF THE INDIVIDUALLY LISTED CHEMICALS, BUT ALSO THE GENERIC STRUCTURES THAT DESCRIBE THE ENTRIES RELATIVE TO FAMILIES OF CHEMICALS (MARKUSH STRUCTURES).","GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY","AMERICAN UNIVERSITY; GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY",NA,"COSTANZI@AMERICAN.EDU","2022-11-29","3Q5BP","10.1515/pac-2021-1107","MAR 2022","1365-3075","GLOBAL AFFAERIRS CANADA [CWC-2020-0001 (P009515)]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY GLOBAL AFFAERIRS CANADA UNDER AWARD CWC-2020-0001 (P009515).","0033-4545","PURE APPL.

WE DEMONSTRATE THAT ULTRAFAST LASER FILAMENT-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE OF CHLOROPHYLL IN THE GREEN ALGA CHLAMYDOMONAS REINHARDTII IS A PROMISING METHOD FOR REMOTE, IN-FIELD DETECTION OF STRESS FROM EXPOSURE TO NUCLEAR MATERIALS. THIS METHOD HOLDS AN ADVANTAGE OVER BROAD-AREA SURVEILLANCE, SUCH AS SOLAR-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE MONITORING, WHEN TARGETING EXCITATION OF A SPECIFIC PLANT WOULD IMPROVE THE DETECTABILITY, FOR EXAMPLE WHEN LOCAL BIOTA DENSITY IS LOW. AFTER EXPOSING C. REINHARDTII TO URANIUM, WE FIND THAT THE CONCENTRATION OF CHLOROPHYLL A, CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE LIFETIME, AND CAROTENOID CONTENT INCREASE. THE INCREASED FLUORESCENCE LIFETIME SIGNIFIES A DECREASE IN NON-PHOTOCHEMICAL QUENCHING. THE SIMULTANEOUS INCREASE IN CAROTENOID CONTENT IMPLIES OXIDATIVE STRESS, FURTHER CONFIRMED BY THE PRODUCTION OF RADICAL OXYGEN SPECIES EVIDENCE IN THE STEADY-STATE ABSORPTION SPECTRUM. THIS IS POTENTIALLY A UNIQUE SIGNATURE OF URANIUM, AS PREVIOUS WORK FINDS THAT HEAVY METAL STRESS GENERALLY INCREASES NON-PHOTOCHEMICAL QUENCHING.

THIS HYDROLYSIS WAS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TO PROCEED SLOWLY OR NOT AT ALL (DEPENDING ON THE PERCENT RELATIVE HUMIDITY); HOWEVER, PREVIOUS REPORTS RELIED PRIMARILY ON X-RAY DIFFRACTION METHODS TO PROBE URANIUM SPECIATION. IN OUR REPORT, WE EMPLOY A BATTERY OF PHYSIOCHEMICAL PROBING TECHNIQUES TO EXPLORE POTENTIAL HYDROLYSIS, INCLUDING RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY, POWDER X-RAY DIFFRACTION, F-19 NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY, SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, AND FOCUSED ION BEAM MICROSCOPY WITH ENERGY-DISPERSIVE X-RAY SPECTROSCOPY. OF THESE, ONLY RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY PROVED TO BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL AT OBSERVING CHEMICAL CHANGES TO UF4. IT WAS FOUND THAT ANHYDROUS UF4 SLIGHTLY OXIDIZES OVER THE COURSE OF THIRTEEN DAYS TO SCHOEPITE-LIKE URANIUM COMPLEXES AND POSSIBLY UO3. IN CONTRAST, UF4 EXPOSED TO 50\% RELATIVE HUMIDITY SLIGHTLY DECOMPOSES INTO UO2F2, SCHOEPITE-LIKE URANIUM COMPLEXES, AND POSSIBLY A HIGH ORDER URANIUM OXIDE THAT ELUDED CHEMICAL ASSIGNMENT (UXOY). DESPITE THE RICH CHEMICAL SPECIATION OBSERVED IN OUR RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY MEASUREMENTS, X-RAY DIFFRACTION AND F-19 NMR MEASUREMENTS ON THE SAME MATERIAL SHOWED NO CHANGES. MICROSCOPY MEASUREMENTS SUGGEST THAT THE OBSERVED REACTIONS BETWEEN UF4 AND WATER OCCUR PRIMARILY ON THE SURFACE OF UF4 PARTICULATES VIA A METHOD THAT IS VISUALLY SIMILAR TO SURFACE CORROSION OF METALS. THEREFORE, WE POSTULATE THAT NMR SPECTROSCOPY AND X-RAY DIFFRACTION, WHICH ARE WELL-SUITED FOR BULK ANALYSIS, ARE LESS SUITED THAN RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY TO OBSERVE THE SURFACE-BASED REACTIONS THAT OCCUR TO UF4 WHEN EXPOSED TO HUMID AIR. CONSIDERING THE IMPORTANCE OF UF4 IN THE PRODUCTION OF NUCLEAR FUEL AND WEAPONS, THE RESULTS PRESENTED HEREIN ARE WIDELY APPLICABLE TO NUMEROUS NUCLEAR SCIENCE FIELDS WHERE URANIUM DETECTION AND SPECIATION IN HUMID ENVIRONMENTS IS OF VALUE, INCLUDING NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION AND NUCLEAR FORENSICS.","THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); SAVANNAH RIVER NATIONAL LABORATORY; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE; UNITED STATES NAVY; NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY",NA,"JONATHAN.CHRISTIAN@SRNL.DOE.GOV CHRISTOPHER.KLUG@NRL.NAVY.MIL","2022-11-29","0L5EG","10.1039/d2dt00196a","MAR 2022","1477-9234","LABORATORY DIRECTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (LDRD) PROGRAM; SAVANNAH RIVER NATIONAL LABORATORY (SRNL); U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY [89303321CEM000080]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE LABORATORY DIRECTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (LDRD) PROGRAM AND DISCOVERY SCIENCE PROGRAM WITHIN THE SAVANNAH RIVER NATIONAL LABORATORY (SRNL).

THE DETERMINATION OF TRACE-LEVEL PU ISOTOPES IN WATER REQUIRES OFFSITE SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS; THEREFORE, NEW METHODS THAT COMBINE PLUTONIUM PURIFICATION, CONCENTRATION, AND ISOTOPIC SCREENING IN A FIELDABLE DETECTION SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE AN INVALUABLE TOOL FOR NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS. THIS CONTRIBUTION DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THIN POLYMER-LIGAND FILMS FOR THE ISOLATION AND CONCENTRATION OF WATERBORNE PU FOR DIRECT SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSES. SUBMICRON THIN FILMS WERE PREPARED THROUGH SPIN COATING ONTO SI WAFERS AND CONSISTED OF COMBINATIONS OF POLYSTYRENE (PS) WITH DIBENZOYLMETHANE, THENOYLTRIFLUOROACETONE, AND DI(2-ETHYLHEXYL)PHOSPHORIC ACID (HDEHP). PU UPTAKE STUDIES FROM SOLUTIONS AT PH FROM 2.3 TO 6.3 INDICATED THAT ONLY FILMS CONTAINING HDEHP EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT RECOVERY OF PU. HIGH ALPHA SPECTROSCOPY PEAK ENERGY RESOLUTIONS WERE ACHIEVED FOR PS-HDEHP FILMS OVER A RANGE OF FILM THICKNESSES FROM 30 TO 250 NM. A SEPARATE STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO EVALUATE UPTAKE FROM A PRIMARILY PU(V) SOLUTION WHERE IT WAS OBSERVED THAT DOUBLING THE HDEHP LOADING IN THE FILM INCREASED UPTAKE OF PU BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY (XPS) ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT HDEHP WAS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED WITHIN THE FIRST FEW NANOMETERS OF THE FILM AT THE HIGHER LOADING. XPS ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED THAT, IN THE PRESENCE OF WATER, HDEHP WAS STRIPPED FROM THE SURFACE LAYER OF THE FILM AT CIRCUMNEUTRAL PH. WHILE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OF LIGAND WERE SEEN IN ALL SAMPLES, HIGHER LOADINGS OF HDEHP RESULTED IN MEASURABLE AMOUNTS OF LIGAND RETAINED AFTER A 12-H SOAK IN WATER. FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY ARE BEING USED TO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIN-FILM COMPOSITE MEMBRANE-BASED DETECTION METHODS FOR THE RAPID, FIELDABLE ANALYSIS OF PU IN WATER.","1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","CLEMSON UNIVERSITY; CLEMSON UNIVERSITY",NA,"SHUSSON@CLEMSON.EDU","2022-11-29","LE2RC","10.1021/acs.analchem.9b05758",NA,"1520-6882","DEFENSE THREAT REDUCTION AGENCY BASIC RESEARCH AWARD [HDTRA1-16-1-0016]; DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION STEWARDSHIP SCIENCE ACADEMIC ALLIANCES AWARD [DE-NA-0002920]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE DEFENSE THREAT REDUCTION AGENCY BASIC RESEARCH AWARD \#HDTRA1-16-1-0016 AND THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION STEWARDSHIP SCIENCE ACADEMIC ALLIANCES AWARD \#DE-NA-0002920 TO CLEMSON UNIVERSITY.

ONE KEY PROBLEM HAS TO DO WITH CREDIBILITY: POTENTIAL AGGRESSORS MAY NOT BELIEVE THAT A COUNTRY WOULD FIGHT TO DEFEND AN ALLY, PARTICULARLY IF DOING SO RISKS A NUCLEAR ATTACK AGAINST ITS HOMELAND. COUNTRIES MIGHT BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY FORGING FORMAL ALLIANCES WITH PROTEGES OR BY STATIONING NUCLEAR FORCES ON THE PROTEGE'S TERRITORY. DO THESE MEASURES DISCOURAGE THIRD-PARTY AGGRESSION? DEFENCE PACTS INVOLVING NUCLEAR-ARMED STATES EFFECTIVELY BOLSTER EXTENDED DETERRENCE. ONE RISK OF EXTENDING NUCLEAR PROTECTION FROM THE AMERICAN PERSPECTIVE, HOWEVER, IS THAT IT MIGHT PULL THE UNITED STATES INTO UNWANTED WARS BY RISK-ACCEPTANT PROTEGES. YET, IN A NUCLEAR CONTEXT, THE RISK OF ALLIANCE ENTRAPMENT IS GENERALLY OVERBLOWN. PLACING NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON AN ALLY'S TERRITORY DOES MUCH LESS TO BOLSTER EXTENDED DETERRENCE THAN ONE MIGHT INITIALLY THINK.

AFTER THE RISKS OF NUCLEAR ASSISTANCE BECAME WELL-KNOWN FOLLOWING INDIA'S NUCLEAR EXPLOSION IN 1974, MOST MAJOR SUPPLIERS CONDITIONED THEIR ASSISTANCE ON RECIPIENTS JOINING NONPROLIFERATION AGREEMENTS. CASE STUDIES OF STATES' DECISION-MAKING REGARDING THESE AGREEMENTS ILLUSTRATE HOW THE PROVISION OF NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN AN EFFECTIVE TOOL IN PERSUADING STATES TO JOIN SUCH AGREEMENTS, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH IS THE TREATY ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS (NPT). BY JOINING THE NPT, STATES STRENGTHEN THE GLOBAL NONPROLIFERATION REGIME AND INCREASE THE COSTS OF ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE DECISION TO PROLIFERATE.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS RESULTS FROM AN INITIAL SCREENING OF MIXED THN-UN FUELS IN NORMAL PWR OPERATING CONDITIONS AND COMPARES THEIR REACTOR PERFORMANCE TO UO2 IN TERMS OF FUEL CYCLE LENGTH, REACTIVITY COEFFICIENTS, AND THERMAL SAFETY MARGIN. THN HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY THAN UO2 AND UN. ADMIXTURE WITH A UN PHASE IS REQUIRED BECAUSE THORIUM INITIALLY CONTAINS NO FISSILE ISOTOPES. RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY SHOW THAT THN-UN MIXTURES EXIST THAT CAN MATCH THE CYCLE LENGTH OF A UO2-FUELED REACTOR BY USING U-235 ENRICHMENTS GREATER THAN 5\% BUT LESS THAN 20\% IN THE UN PHASE. REACTIVITY COEFFICIENTS WERE CALCULATED FOR UO2, UN, AND THN-UN MIXTURES, AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THE FUEL TEMPERATURE AND MODERATOR TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENTS OF THE NITRIDE-BASED FUELS FALL WITHIN THE ACCEPTABLE LIMITS SPECIFIED BY THE AP1000 DESIGN CONTROL DOCUMENT. REDUCED SOLUBLE BORON AND CONTROL ROD WORTH FOR THESE FUEL FORMS INDICATES THAT THE SHUTDOWN MARGIN MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT, AND DESIGN CHANGES TO THE CONTROL SYSTEMS MAY NEED TO BE CONSIDERED. THE NEUTRONIC IMPACT OF N-15 ENRICHMENT ON REACTIVITY COEFFICIENTS IS ALSO INCLUDED. DUE TO THE GREATLY ENHANCED THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF THE NITRIDE-BASED FUELS, THE UN AND THN-UN FUELS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL MARGIN TO FUEL MELTING TEMPERATURE RELATIVE TO UO2.","PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND","UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY","110317","NBROWN49@UTK.EDU","2022-11-29","JJ1CS","10.1016/j.nucengdes.2019.110317",NA,"1872-759X","U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY ADVANCED FUELS CAMPAIGN; US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE) [DE-AC05-00OR22725]","THIS WORK WAS FUNDED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY ADVANCED FUELS CAMPAIGN.

THE VALUE OF K(EFF) CANNOT BE DIRECTLY MEASURED, BUT IT CAN BE INFERRED FROM THE PROMPT NEUTRON PERIOD. ONE MODALITY OF MEASURING THE PROMPT NEUTRON PERIOD IS THE ROSSI-ALPHA METHOD, WHICH IS PREDICATED ON FITTING A HISTOGRAM OF DETECTION TIME DIFFERENCES DUE TO THE NONRANDOM TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF SAME-FISSION-CHAIN NEUTRONS. RECENT WORKS HAVE DEVELOPED THE MOTIVATION AND THEORY TO EXPAND TRADITIONAL ONE-REGION POINT KINETIC MODELS RESULTING IN ONE-EXPONENTIAL HISTOGRAM FITS TO TWO-REGION MODELS THAT RESULT IN TWO-EXPONENTIAL FITS. THIS PAPER VALIDATES THE NEW TWO-REGION MODEL USING ORGANIC SCINTILLATOR MEASUREMENTS OF COPPER-REFLECTED WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM (0.83 <= K(EFF) <= 0.94) AND HIGH-DENSITY-POLYETHYLENE-REFLECTED HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM (0.73 <= K(EFF) <= 0.95). FURTHERMORE, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT MORE THERMAL SYSTEMS HAVE SHORTER PROMPT NEUTRON PERIODS IN THE CORE REGION DUE TO INCREASED INDUCED-FISSION PROBABILITIES FOR MODERATED NEUTRONS. A NEW PARAMETER INTRODUCED BY THE TWO-REGION MODEL IS ALSO SHOWN TO BE CORRELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF REFLECTION, AND MAY BE USED TO INFER ASSEMBLY PROPERTIES SUCH AS TYPE AND AMOUNT OF REFLECTOR.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY","164535","MIKWA@UMICH.EDU","2022-11-29","OG3PF","10.1016/j.nima.2020.164535",NA,"1872-9576","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION GRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP [DGE-1256260]; CONSORTIUM FOR VERIFICATION TECHNOLOGY UNDER DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION [DE-NA0002534]; CONSORTIUM FOR MONITORING, TECHNOLOGY, AND VERIFICATION UNDER DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION [DE-NA0003920]; DOE NUCLEAR CRITICALITY SAFETY PROGRAM - NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY","THIS WORK WAS PARTIALLY SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION GRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP UNDER GRANT NO.

IN ACTIVE NEUTRON MULTIPLICITY COUNTING, THE NEUTRON DOUBLES AND TRIPLES MULTIPLICITY RATES ARE USED TO ANALYTICALLY CALCULATE SAMPLE MASS. TO DISTINGUISH THE MASSES OF TWO DIFFERENT SAMPLES, THE MEASURED TRIPLES AND DOUBLES RATES OF EACH SAMPLE MUST BE SEPARATED BY 1 SIGMA. THE TIME IT TAKES EACH SYSTEM TO SEPARATE THE MEASURED TRIPLES MULTIPLICITY RATES WAS COMPARED USING 20 METAL SAMPLES OF NP-237 WITH MASSES LOGARITHMICALLY DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN 10 AND 1000 G. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE OSMC CAN DISTINGUISH THE SMALLEST MASSES (10.0 AND 12.7 G) BEYOND 1 SIGMA IN 20 MIN AND THAT THE ENMC REQUIRES MORE THAN 400 TIMES THE MEASUREMENT TIME TO OBTAIN THE SAME PRECISION.

THE METHOD AND QUANTITY ARE OF WIDESPREAD INTEREST INCLUDING IN APPLICATIONS SUCH AS NUCLEAR CRITICALITY SAFETY, SAFEGUARDS AND NONPROLIFERATION, AND STOCKPILE STEWARDSHIP; THE PROMPT NEUTRON PERIOD MAY ALSO BE USED TO INFER THE K(EFF) MULTIPLICATION FACTOR. THE FEYNMAN-ALPHA METHOD IS PREDICATED ON TIME-CORRELATED NEUTRON DETECTIONS THAT DEVIATE FROM A POISSON RANDOM VARIABLE DUE TO MULTIPLICATION. TRADITIONALLY, SUCH MEASUREMENTS ARE DIAGNOSED WITH ONE-REGION POINT KINETICS, BUT TWO-REGION MODELS ARE REQUIRED WHEN THE FISSILE ASSEMBLY IS REFLECTED. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A DERIVATION OF THE TWO-REGION POINT KINETICS FEYNMAN-ALPHA EQUATIONS BASED ON A DOUBLE INTEGRATION OF THE ROSSI-ALPHA EQUATIONS, DEVELOPS NOVEL PROPAGATION OF MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY, AND VALIDATES THE THEORY. VALIDATION IS ACHIEVED WITH ORGANIC SCINTILLATOR MEASUREMENTS OF WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM REFLECTED BY VARIOUS AMOUNTS OF COPPER TO ACHIEVE K(EFF) VALUES OF 0.83-0.94 AND PROMPT PERIODS OF 5-75 NS. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT FEYNMAN-ALPHA MEASUREMENTS SHOULD USE THE TWO-REGION MODEL INSTEAD OF THE ONE-REGION MODEL. THE SIMPLIFIED ONE-REGION MODEL DEVIATES FROM THE VALIDATED TWO-REGION MODELS BY AS MUCH AS 10\% IN THE ESTIMATE OF THE PROMPT NEUTRON PERIOD, AND THE TWO-REGION MODEL REDUCES TO THE ONE-REGION MODEL FOR SMALL AMOUNTS OF REFLECTOR. THE FEYNMAN-ALPHA ESTIMATES OF THE PROMPT NEUTRON PERIOD ARE COMPARED TO THOSE OF THE ROSSI-ALPHA APPROACH. THE COMPARATIVE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FEYNMAN-ALPHA METHOD IS MORE PRECISE THAN THE ROSSI-ALPHA METHOD AND MORE ACCURATE FOR K(EFF) < 0:92, WHEREAS THE ROSSI-ALPHA METHOD IS GENERALLY MORE ACCURATE FOR HIGHER MULTIPLICATIONS. THE UNCERTAINTY PROPAGATION DEVELOPED IN THIS WORK SHOULD BE USED FOR ALL FEYNMAN-ALPHA MEASUREMENTS AND WILL THEREIN IMPROVE FITTING ACCURACY AND APPROPRIATE PRECISION ESTIMATES.

THE TWO LARGER CHEMICAL EXPLOSIONS OF 50 TONS (DAG-2) AND 10 TONS (DAG-4) TNT EQUIVALENT YIELD TRIGGERED ENERGETIC AFTERSHOCK SEQUENCES NUMBERING 1392 AND 347 MICROEARTHQUAKES, RESPECTIVELY, WITHIN THE FIRST 10 DAYS. NO SIGNIFICANT AFTERSHOCK ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED FOR THE TWO SMALLER 1-TON EXPLOSIONS (DAG-1 AND DAG-3). WE USED A BACK-PROJECTION METHOD BASED ON TRAVEL-TIME MIGRATION AND STACKING OF SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO TRACES TO DETECT, ASSOCIATE AND LOCATE AFTERSHOCKS FROM A SUBSET OF 22-GEOPHONES WITHIN A LARGER 2 X 2 KM SEISMIC ARRAY SURROUNDING THE BOREHOLE. THE AFTERSHOCKS LOCATED WITHIN 300 M OF THE BOREHOLE AND THE DEPTHS WERE ABOVE THE WORKING POINTS OF 300 AND 50 M DEPTHS OF DAG-2 AND DAG-4, RESPECTIVELY, RULING OUT TRIGGERING SLIP ON GEOLOGIC FAULTS OR DISTURBANCES BENEATH NEIGHBORING COLLAPSE CRATERS. DAG-2 AND DAG-4 AFTERSHOCKS DECAYED AT SIMILAR RATES, WITH POWER-LAW EXPONENTS OF P = 1.48 AND P = 1.49, RESPECTIVELY. THESE DECAY RATES ARE COMPARABLE TO AFTERSHOCKS SEQUENCES TRIGGERED BY EARTHQUAKES AND HISTORICAL NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS AT YUCCA FLAT. A SMOOTH POWER-LAW AFTERSHOCK DECAY WITHIN THE FIRST 10 DAYS SUGGESTS A TRIGGERING MECHANISM FROM EXPLOSION GENERATED STRESS RELAXATION DUE TO THE DIFFUSION OF HIGH GAS PRESSURES IN THE CAVITY AND RADIAL FRACTURES. A MORE RANDOM AND EPISODIC AFTERSHOCK RATE WOULD BE EXPECTED DUE TO CAVITY COLLAPSE OR FALLING RUBBLE IN CHIMNEY FORMATION. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY LARGE EARTHQUAKES TRIGGER SEQUENCES OF SMALLER EARTHQUAKES WHICH ARE CLUSTERED IN SPACE AND TIME AND ARE KNOWN AS AFTERSHOCKS. EXPLOSIONS ALSO TRIGGER AFTERSHOCKS THAT BEHAVE SIMILAR TO EARTHQUAKE-TRIGGERED AFTERSHOCKS. HOWEVER, NOT ALL EXPLOSIONS TRIGGER AFTERSHOCKS AND IF THEY DO, THE AFTERSHOCKS ARE FEWER, SMALLER IN SIZE, AND LIMITED TO A FEW KILOMETERS FROM THE POINT OF THE EXPLOSION. DETECTION OF EXPLOSION-TRIGGERED AFTERSHOCKS AFTER A SUSPECTED NUCLEAR TEST HELPS INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS LOCATE AN AREA FOR ON-SITE-INSPECTION AND DIFFERENTIATE EXPLOSIONS FROM EARTHQUAKES WHICH REDUCES FALSE ALARMS. FOUR CHEMICAL EXPLOSIONS WERE CONDUCTED AT THE NEVADA NATIONAL SECURITY SITE AS AN EXPERIMENT TO STUDY THE PHYSICS OF UNDERGROUND EXPLOSIONS FOR IMPROVING NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION VERIFICATION AND MONITORING CAPABILITIES. WE DETECTED 1392 EXPLOSION-TRIGGERED AFTERSHOCKS FROM THE LARGEST TEST EXPLOSION AND ANOTHER EXPLOSION ONE-FIFTH THE SIZE TRIGGERED ONLY 347 AFTERSHOCKS WITHIN THE FIRST 10 DAYS. THESE AFTERSHOCKS HAVE VERY SMALL MAGNITUDES AND WENT UNFELT AT THE TEST SITE. WE CREATED A CATALOG AND CONTINUOUS TIMELINE OF EXPLOSION-TRIGGERED AFTERSHOCKS DURING THE EXPERIMENTS SHOWING THAT AFTERSHOCKS LOCATE NEAR THE EXPLOSION BOREHOLE RATHER THAN BEING TRIGGERED ON CLOSELY LOCATED GEOLOGIC FAULTS OR DISTURBANCES BENEATH SIMILAR TO 50 NEIGHBORING COLLAPSE CRATERS CREATED BY HISTORICAL UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS.","2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY","E2020JB021312","ICHINOSE1@LLNL.GOV","2022-11-29","SI0NX","10.1029/2020JB021312",NA,"2169-9356","U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION [DE-AC52-07NA27344]","THE SOURCE PHYSICS EXPERIMENT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF MANY PEOPLE FROM SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS.

THAT CONVICTION, IN TURN, PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN POLICY DEBATES AMONG EXPERTS IN THIS AREA. IN THIS ARTICLE, I SHOW THAT NONPROLIFERATION DOES NOT NECESSARILY TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER OTHER IMPORTANT US GEOPOLITICAL INTERESTS THROUGH A CLOSE EXAMINATION OF AMERICAN POLICY TOWARD THE ISRAELI NUCLEAR PROGRAM DURING THE 1960S. ALTHOUGH NONPROLIFERATION GOALS CERTAINLY CAME INTO PLAY, US OFFICIALS REPEATEDLY GAVE PRIORITY TO OTHER KEY OBJECTIVES AND, TO A REAL EXTENT, EVEN BELIEVED THAT ISRAEL'S NUCLEARIZATION COULD HOLD CERTAIN STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES. THIS FINDING, OF COURSE, HAS IMPORTANT THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BASIC QUESTION OF WHETHER INTERNATIONAL POLITICS STILL WORKS ESSENTIALLY AS IT DID IN THE PRE-NUCLEAR ERA, AS WELL AS FOR POLICY DEBATES OVER NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION.","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","WILLIAMS COLLEGE",NA,NA,"2022-11-29","HY4AQ","10.1080/09636412.2019.1551570",NA,"1556-1852","WILLIAMS COLLEGE STANLEY KAPLAN PROGRAM; STANTON FOUNDATION; CLEMENTS CENTER FOR NATIONAL SECURITY","WILLIAMS COLLEGE STANLEY KAPLAN PROGRAM; STANTON FOUNDATION; CLEMENTS CENTER FOR NATIONAL SECURITY;","0963-6412","SECUR.

THE QUALITY OF THE STE DEPENDS PARTIALLY ON THE TIME AND SPACE SCALES OF THE OBSERVATIONS, SENSOR LOCATIONS, AND RELEASE PARAMETERS. WE QUANTIFY THE SENSITIVITY OF A PROBABILISTIC STE ALGORITHM THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY VALIDATED USING OBSERVATIONAL DATA COLLECTED DURING A CONTROLLED TRACER RELEASE EXPERIMENT TO THE SPATIOTEMPORAL RESOLUTION OF OBSERVING NETWORKS. WE HAVE ALSO MADE MANY IMPROVEMENTS TO THE STE ALGORITHM, WHICH EXTENDS APPLICABILITY TO COARSER-RESOLUTION OBSERVATIONAL DATASETS. IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDE THE USE OF A FULLY-CONNECTED DEEP NEURAL NETWORK MODEL EMULATOR WITH DYNAMICALLY OPTIMIZED ARCHITECTURE AND BETTER GOODNESS-OF-FIT (GOF) METRICS TO MEASURE THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MODEL AND OBSERVATIONAL DATA. THE GOF METRICS, WHICH ARE MORE ROBUST AND RESILIENT THAN PREVIOUS METRICS, ARE THE SPEARMAN RANK-BASED CORRELATION COEFFICIENT AND A VARIATION OF THE BINARY CLASSIFICATION SCORE ADAPTED FOR REGRESSION PROBLEMS. USING SYNTHETICALLY GENERATED OBSERVATIONS OVER EAST ASIA, THE SKILL OF THE IMPROVED ALGORITHM IS QUANTIFIED OVER A BROAD RANGE OF SENSOR CONFIGURATIONS AND RELEASE SCENARIOS. THE EVALUATION IS BROKEN INTO THREE EXPERIMENTS. FIRST, A VALIDATION STUDY SHOWS THAT THE PROPOSED GOF METRICS PERFORM MORE RELIABLY THAN OTHER POSSIBLE CANDIDATES. NEXT, DATA-DENIAL TECHNIQUES ARE APPLIED TO A SINGLE RELEASE SCENARIO OVER THE KOREAN PENINSULA, WHERE THE SKILL OF THE INVERSION IS SHOWN TO BE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO THE NUMBER AND LOCATION OF DEPLOYED SENSORS BUT LESS SENSITIVE TO TEMPORAL RESOLUTION. FINALLY, THE STE ALGORITHM IS TESTED FOR MANY RELEASE LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE GEOGRAPHIC MODEL DOMAIN, WHERE THE STE ALGORITHM PERFORMS WELL FOR ALL BUT A FEW CASES. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE STE ALGORITHM PROVIDES INFORMATIVE SOURCE-PARAMETER POSTERIOR PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS UTILIZING DATA COLLECTED BY SPARSE SENSOR NETWORKS; HOWEVER, THE SKILL OF THE STE ALGORITHM IMPROVES SIGNIFICANTLY FOR HIGHER RESOLUTION NETWORKS.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY","100045","JENSEN54@LLNL.GOV","2022-11-29","LK1TY","10.1016/j.aeaoa.2019.100045",NA,"2590-1621","U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY BY LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; U.S. NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION OFFICE OF DEFENSE NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT [LLNL-JRNL-761940]","THIS WORK WAS PERFORMED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY BY LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY UNDER CONTRACT DE-AC52-07NA27344 AND WITH SUPPORT FROM THE U.S. NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION OFFICE OF DEFENSE NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

ON ONE HAND, WERE ITS LONG-HELD PRINCIPLES SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO PEACEFUL USES OF NUCLEAR ENERGY (INCLUDING PNE'S) AND THE RIGHT TO NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY COOPERATION FOR PEACEFUL PURPOSES. ON THE OTHER HAND, WERE THE PRAGMATIC POLICY CHOICES IT HAD TO MAKE AS ADVANCED NUCLEAR STATES WORKED TOWARDS A STRICTER NONPROLIFERATION REGIME. IN THIS STRUGGLE BETWEEN INDIA'S PRINCIPLES AND ITS NECESSITIES, INDIA'S NUCLEAR BEHAVIOR WAS GUIDED MUCH MORE BY PRAGMATISM RATHER THAN BY ITS NORMATIVE PREFERENCES.

AL2O3 ALSO HAS GREAT POTENTIAL AS A FUNCTIONAL THIN FILM DEVICE IN OPTOELECTRONICS. WHEN IT IS DOPED WITH CARBON (AL2O3 :C), THIS MATERIAL SYSTEM CAN SERVE AS A RELIABLE RADIATION DOSIMETER. THE COMBINATION OF OPTOELECTRONIC, DOSIMETRIC, AND PROTECTIVE PROPERTIES DEMONSTRATED BY AL2O3 UNIQUELY POSITIONS IT FOR DUAL USE APPLICATIONS IN NUCLEAR FORENSICS, NONPROLIFERATION AND SAFEGUARDS, EMERGENCY RESPONSE, RETROSPECTIVE DOSIMETRY, AND NONDESTRUCTIVE INSPECTION. IN THIS STUDY, AN INNOVATIVE ULTRASONIC MIST-CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (MIST-CVD) SYSTEM WAS USED TO DEPOSIT THIN (NM LEVEL) AL2O3 COATINGS ON 304 STAINLESS STEEL SUBSTRATES. THE SINGLE ALIQUOT REGENERATION (SAR) AND ADDITIVE DOSE RECONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES WERE THEN USED TO INVESTIGATE THE THERMOLUMINESCENCE (TL) AND OPTICALLY STIMULATED LUMINESCENCE (OSL) RESPONSE OF THE COATED SUBSTRATES TO INCREASING DOSES OF BETA IRRADIATION. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT NM-THICK AL2O3 COATINGS HOLD PROMISE AS NOVEL NANO-DOSIMETERS WHICH COULD BE LEVERAGED FOR A SERIES OF APPLICATIONS SUCH AS NONPROLIFERATION AND SAFEGUARDS, RETROSPECTIVE DOSIMETRY, AND NONDESTRUCTIVE INSPECTION.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA; NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY","109860","GYANG9@NCSU.EDU","2022-11-29","XA1AA","10.1016/j.radphyschem.2021.109860","NOV 2021","1879-0895","U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY'S NUCLEAR ENERGY UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS [DE-NE0008944]; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY THROUGH AN INTEGRATED UNIVERSITY PROGRAM GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP","THIS WORK IS SUPPORTED IN PART BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY'S NUCLEAR ENERGY UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS (AWARDS NO: DE-NE0008944) .

THREE CHALLENGES REFLECT GENERIC PROBLEMS IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS. THESE ARE DIFFERENCES IN POWER, THE COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEM, AND TRADE-OFFS WITH OTHER INTERESTS. THREE ADDITIONAL DILEMMAS REFLECT SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NUCLEAR REALM. FIRST, MEMBERSHIP IN INTERNATIONAL TREATIES CONNECTED TO THE NORMS IS NOT UNIVERSAL, RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE APPROPRIATENESS OF ENFORCEMENT AGAINST STATES THAT HAVE NOT SIGNED THE TREATIES. SECOND, DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS OF THE NORMS CAN COME INTO CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER. IN PARTICULAR, THERE CAN BE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE REQUIREMENTS OF NONPROLIFERATION AND DISARMAMENT NORMS. FINALLY, SOME COMMON OPTIONS FOR NORM ENFORCEMENT BECOME QUITE PROBLEMATIC WHEN DEALING WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF STATES RESPOND TO DEFECTIONS BY STARTING THEIR OWN NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMS, THIS TIT-FOR-TAT RESPONSE WOULD DEFEAT THE PURPOSES OF THE NONPROLIFERATION REGIME. DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES, NUCLEAR NORMS ENJOY WIDESPREAD SUPPORT AND SOME ENFORCEMENT IS POSSIBLE.","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",NA,NA,"JKNOPF@MIIS.EDU","2022-11-29","GR5JN","10.1080/13523260.2018.1431446",NA,"1743-8764","U.S. INSTITUTE OF PEACE ANNUAL GRANT, NUCLEAR NORMS IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE [160-12F]","THIS ARTICLE HAS ALSO BENEFITED FROM FUNDING FROM THE U.S. INSTITUTE OF PEACE ANNUAL GRANT, NUCLEAR NORMS IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE, 160-12F.","1352-3260","CONTEMP.

THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF THREE NONPROLIFERATION TOOLS AVAILABLE TO A NUCLEAR PATRON: A DECLARATION OF EXTENDED DETERRENCE, FORWARD DEPLOYMENT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, AND A CONDITIONAL THREAT OF PUNISHMENT. MORE SPECIFICALLY, USING EXPERIMENTAL DATA ON THE SOUTH KOREAN PUBLIC, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES WHETHER NUCLEAR FORWARD-DEPLOYMENT AND A CONDITIONAL THREAT OF PUNISHMENT ARE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN A DECLARATORY POLICY IN ENHANCING THE CREDIBILITY OF EXTENDED DETERRENCE AND CURBING PUBLIC ASPIRATIONS FOR NUCLEARIZATION. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT NEITHER NUCLEAR FORWARD-DEPLOYMENT NOR A CONDITIONAL THREAT OF PUNISHMENT REDUCES PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR NUCLEAR ARMAMENT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN A DECLARATORY POLICY. THEY ALSO REVEAL THAT COMPARED TO WHEN A NUCLEAR ALLY DOES NOT EXIST, THE THREE NONPROLIFERATION TOOLS DO NOT NECESSARILY DAMPEN THE PUBLIC'S PREFERENCE FOR DEVELOPING INDIGENOUS NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE FINDINGS IS ASSESSED USING AN EXPERIMENT ON A SMALL SAMPLE OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.

HOWEVER, STATES DO NOT UNIFORMLY PURSUE NUCLEAR WEAPONIZATION BUT PROCEED ALONG DIFFERENT PATHS LINED BY DECISIONS AFFECTING STATE RESOURCES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION. THESE DECISIONS, WHICH MAY DELAY OR UNDERMINE A PROGRAM, ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION PROCESSES AND OUTCOMES. USING A NEW DATA SET OF NON-TERMINATION NUCLEAR REVERSAL DECISIONS ACROSS THREE KEY ASPECTS OF PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT, I CAPTURE MORE OF THE PROCESS OF NUCLEAR REVERSAL. I INVESTIGATE WHETHER TWO MAJOR NONPROLIFERATION INSTITUTIONS, THE NUCLEAR SUPPLIERS GROUP (NSG) AND THE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY (NPT), INFLUENCE STATE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN ONGOING PROGRAMS. I ARGUE THAT NSG MEMBERS HAVE STRENGTHENED COOPERATION ACROSS THREE DISTINCT POLICY ERAS AND FIND THAT THE NGS'S MARKET CONTROLS HAVE GENERATED MATERIAL CONSTRAINTS THAT RAISE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT STATES WILL MAKE NUCLEAR REVERSAL DECISIONS. I DO NOT FIND EVIDENCE THAT THE NPT CONTRIBUTES TO REVERSAL DECISIONS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ONGOING PROGRAMS.

PREVIOUSLY-MEASURED PROTON AND CARBON LIGHT YIELD DATA WERE EXAMINED FOR A VARIETY OF COMMERCIAL AND NOVEL ORGANIC SCINTILLATING MEDIA: EJ-309, A LIQUID WITH PULSE SHAPE DISCRIMINATION (PSD) PROPERTIES; EJ-204, A FAST PLASTIC; EJ-276, A PSD-CAPABLE PLASTIC; AND A CUSTOM ORGANIC GLASS SCINTILLATOR DEVELOPED BY SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES. THE CANONICAL MODEL OF BIRKS DID NOT ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE THE IONIZATION QUENCHING BEHAVIOR. MODELS PROPOSED BY YOSHIDA ET AL. AND VOLTZ ET AL. PROVIDED A REASONABLE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTON LIGHT YIELD OF A VARIETY OF ORGANIC SCINTILLATORS OVER A BROAD ENERGY RANGE, BUT ADDITIONAL WORK IS NEEDED TO EXTEND THE MODELS TO CARBON IONS. THE IMPACT OF STOPPING POWER DATA WAS ALSO INVESTIGATED BY COMPARING MODEL PREDICTIONS USING SRIM AND PSTAR/MSTAR LIBRARIES, AND THE RESULTS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT DISCREPANCY FOR CARBON IONS. THIS WORK ENHANCES UNDERSTANDING OF IONIZATION QUENCHING AND FACILITATES THE ACCURATE MODELING OF SCINTILLATOR-BASED NEUTRON DETECTION SYSTEMS RELEVANT FOR MEDICAL PHYSICS, NUCLEAR SECURITY AND NONPROLIFERATION, AND BASIC SCIENCE STUDIES.","THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES",NA,"LAPTHI@BERKELEY.EDU BETHANY@LBL.GOV","2022-11-29","2Z4IL","10.1039/d2ma00388k","JUN 2022","2633-5409","US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY BY LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND SECURITY CONSORTIUM [DE-NA0003180, DE-NA0003996]; US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, OFFICE OF DEFENSE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (DNN RD); US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION [DE-NA0003525]","THE AUTHORS ARE GRATEFUL FOR DISCUSSIONS AND EXPERT ADVICE FROM THE SINGLE VOLUME SCATTER CAMERA COLLABORATION.

THE KILOTON-SCALE KAMLAND EXPERIMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED A CAPABILITY TO DETECT REACTOR ANTINEUTRINOS AT A RANGE OF A FEW HUNDRED KILOMETERS. BUT TO DETECT OR RULE OUT THE EXISTENCE OF A SINGLE SMALL REACTOR OVER MANY KILOMETERS REQUIRES A LARGE DETECTOR, SO LARGE IN FACT THAT THE OPTICAL OPACITY OF THE DETECTION MEDIUM ITSELF BECOMES AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. IF THE DETECTOR IS SO LARGE THAT PHOTONS CANNOT TRAVERSE THE DETECTOR MEDIUM TO AN OPTICAL DETECTOR, THEN IT BECOMES IMPRACTICAL. FOR THIS REASON, GADOLINIUM-DOPED-WATER CHERENKOV DETECTORS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR LARGE VOLUMES, DUE TO THEIR APPEALING LIGHT-ATTENUATION PROPERTIES. EVEN THOUGH CHERENKOV EMISSION DOES NOT PRODUCE MANY PHOTONS AND THE ENERGY RESOLUTION IS POOR, THERE MAY BE A PLACE FOR GD-DOPED-WATER DETECTORS IN FAR-FIELD NUCLEAR-REACTOR MONITORING. IN THIS PAPER, WE FOCUS ON THE REACTOR-DISCOVERY POTENTIAL OF LARGE-VOLUME GD-DOPED-WATER CHERENKOV DETECTORS FOR NUCLEAR-NONPROLIFERATION APPLICATIONS. REALISTIC BACKGROUND MODELS FOR THE WORLDWIDE REACTOR FLUX, GEONEUTRINOS, COSMOGENIC FAST NEUTRONS, AND DETECTORASSOCIATED BACKGROUNDS ARE INCLUDED. WE CALCULATE THE DETECTOR RUN TIME REQUIRED TO DETECT A SMALL 50-MWT REACTOR AT A VARIETY OF STAND-OFF DISTANCES AS A FUNCTION OF DETECTOR SIZE. WE HIGHLIGHT THAT, AT PRESENT, THE PHOTOMULTIPLIER-TUBE DARK RATE AND EVENT RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS ARE THE LIMITING FACTORS TO EXTENDING SUCH DETECTORS BEYOND A FIDUCIAL MASS OF APPROXIMATELY 50 KT.","ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA","UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY","034059","LI68@LLNL.GOV","2022-11-29","5E1XS","10.1103/PhysRevApplied.18.034059",NA,NA,"U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION; LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY [DE-AC52-07NA27344]","THIS WORK IS SUPPORTED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION AND LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY (CONTRACT NO.

CONSIDERING THE HIGH ALPHA DECAY HEAT OF PU-238, INCREASING THE ISOTOPIC FRACTION LEADS TO A NOTICEABLY HIGHER AMOUNT OF HEAT GENERATION WITHIN THE PLUTONIUM. HIGH HEAT GENERATION IS ESPECIALLY UNATTRACTIVE IN THE SCENARIO OF WEAPONIZATION. UPON WEAPONIZATION OF THE PLUTONIUM, THE PLUTONIUM MAY GENERATE ENOUGH HEAT TO ELEVATE THE TEMPERATURE IN THE HIGH EXPLOSIVES TO ABOVE ITS SELF-EXPLOSION TEMPERATURE, RENDERING THE WEAPON USELESS. IN ADDITION, ELEVATED TEMPERATURES WILL CAUSE THERMAL EXPANSION IN THE COMPONENTS OF A NUCLEAR EXPLOSIVE DEVICE THAT MAY PRODUCE THERMAL STRESSES HIGH ENOUGH TO PRODUCE FAILURE IN THE MATERIALS, REDUCING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE WEAPON. UNDERSTANDING THE TECHNICAL LIMIT OF PU-238 REQUIRED TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF WEAPONIZATION IS KEY TO REDUCING THE CURRENT LIMIT ON SAFEGUARDED PLUTONIUM (GREATER THAN 80 AT. \% PU-238). THE PLUTONIUM VECTOR EVALUATED IN THIS STUDY WAS FOUND BY SIMULATING PUBLIC INFORMATION ON LIGHTBRIDGE'S FUEL DESIGN FOR PRESSURIZED WATER REACTORS. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE TEMPERATURE PROFILE AND MAXIMUM STRESS WITHIN A SIMPLE (FIRST GENERATION DESIGN) HYPOTHETICAL NUCLEAR EXPLOSIVE DEVICE OF FOUR UNIQUE SCENARIOS OVER TIME. ANALYZING THE TRANSIENT DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH THE TEMPERATURE PROFILE AND MAXIMUM STRESS NOT ONLY ESTABLISHES A TECHNICAL LIMIT ON THE PU-238 CONTENT, BUT ALSO ESTABLISHES A TIME LIMIT FOR WHICH EACH SCENARIO WOULD BE USEABLE.

WHILE THE ISSUE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED EXTENSIVELY IN THE POLICY COMMUNITY AND USED AS A POWERFUL RHETORICAL TOOL TO MOTIVATE TANGENTIALLY RELATED POLICIES SUCH AS SUBSIDIZING EXISTING U.S. NUCLEAR PLANTS, NO ONE HAS SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESSED THE ISSUE, STRUCTURED THE PROBLEM AND PROPOSED AND EVALUATED POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS. HERE WE BRIEFLY ANALYZE THE CURRENT INTERNATIONAL STATE OF PLAY, AND THEN OUTLINE A SET OF SPECIFIC STRATEGIES THE U.S. MIGHT ADOPT ON ITS OWN, OR PROMOTE INTERNATIONALLY, TO RETAIN ITS INFLUENCE. BUILDING ON THE LITERATURE, NUCLEAR SECURITY AND NUCLEAR POWER EXPERTS ASSISTED US IN FRAMING THE ISSUES AND THEN, IN A PARTICIPATORY WORKSHOP, HELPED US TO ASSESS AND REFINE POSSIBLE STRATEGIES. WHILE NOT ALL EXPERTS AGREED THAT U.S. INFLUENCE HAS ALREADY DECLINED, MOST INDICATED THAT IT LIKELY WOULD DECLINE IN THE FUTURE IF PRESENT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TRENDS CONTINUE.

THE GOALS WERE TO SIMPLIFY SINGLE FILAMENT TIMS SAMPLE PREPARATION FOR PU, WHILE PRESERVING THE SENSITIVITY AND ACCURACY OF THE RESIN BEAD LOADING METHOD, AND TO ELIMINATE SAMPLE LOSSES EXPERIENCED WITH THE BEAD LOADING METHOD. RHENIUM FILAMENTS WERE DEGASSED, DIP-COATED WITH A THIN (SIMILAR TO 120 NM) HYDROPHOBIC BASE LAYER OF POLY(VINYLBENZYL CHLORIDE) (PVBC), AND SPOTTED WITH AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION COMPRISING TRIETHYLAMINE-QUATERNIZED PVBC AND DIAZABICYCLO[2.2.2]OCTANE CROSSLINKER.

THE THIN FILM-COATED FILAMENTS WERE DIRECT LOADED WITH 10 PG OF NEW BRUNSWICK LABORATORY CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIAL (NBL CRM) 128 FROM A 9 M HCL MATRIX. AQUEOUS SAMPLE DROPLETS ADHERED TO THE ANION-EXCHANGE POLYMER SPOT, FACILITATING SAMPLE LOADING. TOROIDAL SPOTS WITH A THICKNESS OF 20-30 GM GENERATED THE HIGHEST SAMPLE UTILIZATION, SURPASSING THE SAMPLE UTILIZATION OF THE STANDARD BEAD LOADING METHOD BY 175\%. MEASURED ISOTOPIC RATIOS WERE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE CERTIFIED VALUE OF THE PU-239/PU-242 RATIO FOR NBL CRM 128. THE USE OF DIMPLED FILAMENTS FURTHER AIDED SAMPLE LOADING BY PROVIDING A WELL-SHAPED SUBSTRATE TO DEPOSIT THE SAMPLE DROPLET. NO SAMPLE LOSSES WERE EXPERIENCED WITH THE THIN FILM LOADING METHOD OVER 65 SAMPLE ANALYSES.

THE USE OF A LASER-PLASMA ACCELERATOR OFFERS ELECTRONS AT THE ENERGIES NEEDED FOR MULTI-MEV THOMSON SOURCES IN A COMPACT FORM FACTOR. BECAUSE THESE ELECTRONS HAVE ENERGY UP TO APPROXIMATELY 0.5 GEV, MANY ENERGETIC PHOTONS AND NEUTRONS ARE CREATED AS THEY ARE DUMPED OUT OF THE BEAM LINE. THIS FACT CREATES CHALLENGES FOR PERFORMING EXPERIMENTS TO DEMONSTRATE THE ADVANTAGES OF SUCH A PHOTON SOURCE FOR NONPROLIFERATION APPLICATIONS IN THE SHORT TERM, UNTIL EFFECTIVE METHODS FOR DECELERATING THE ELECTRONS ARE DEVELOPED. TO MITIGATE THESE BACKGROUND PARTICLES FOR LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS, A SYSTEM OF BEAM DUMPS AND SECONDARY COLLIMATORS HAS BEEN DESIGNED. ONCE BACKGROUND FLUX IS REDUCED TO THE LOWEST PRACTICAL LEVEL, IT IS COMPARED TO THE EXPECTED FLUX CREATED BY THE SOURCE PHOTON BEAM ON A LEAD TARGET. THIS SIMULATION MIMICS A NONPROLIFERATION APPLICATION BY PREDICTING MEASURED FLUX OFF-AXIS FROM AN INTERROGATED HIGH-Z OBJECT AS A SURROGATE FOR SPECIAL NUCLEAR MATERIAL.

AND YET, WITHIN THE YEAR THEY WERE SMILING AND HANDSHAKING IN SINGAPORE, FOLLOWED NOT LONG AFTER BY A SECOND SUMMIT IN VIETNAM. THESE SUMMITS, FOCUSED ON THE PROSPECT OF NORTH KOREA'S DENUCLEARIZATION, HAVE IN FACT RAISED IMPORTANT QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE LEGITIMACY OF NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM: DOES THE WILLINGNESS OF A SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT TO MEET WITH THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER CONSTITUTE DE FACTO RECOGNITION OF NORTH KOREA AS A NUCLEAR-WEAPON STATE? HAS NORTH KOREA JOINED INDIA, PAKISTAN, AND ISRAEL AS A MEMBER OF THE ``FINAL FOUR''-THE NUCLEAR-WEAPON STATES THAT EXIST OUTSIDE OF THE FRAMEWORK PROMULGATED BY THE TREATY ON THE NONPROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS? INTERNATIONAL LAW DOES NOT OFFER CLEAR ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS, BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DEFINING DE FACTO NUCLEAR-WEAPON STATE (DNWS) STATUS IS PARAMOUNT, LEST THE UNITED STATES OR ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO ENGAGE WITH NORTH KOREA AND UNWITTINGLY OFFERS THE LEGITIMACY THAT IT DESIRES. CONSEQUENTLY, THIS NOTE SETS OUT TO IDENTIFY A ``NUCLEAR RECOGNITION THRESHOLD''-THE POINT AT WHICH A NUCLEAR-ARMED STATE CAN ACCURATELY BE CONSIDERED A DNWS. IN THIS RESPECT, THE LAW ON DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION SERVES AS A VALUABLE REFERENCE POINT IN FORMULATING A ``WORKING TEST'' TO IDENTIFY STATES THAT HAVE CROSSED (OR ARE LIKELY TO CROSS) THIS THRESHOLD. BY ARTICULATING A WORKING TEST FOR DNWS STATUS, THIS NOTE HOPES TO ENCOURAGE MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO BE MORE COGNIZANT OF THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH WOULD-BE NUCLEAR PROLIFER-ANTS, AS SUCH RELATIONSHIPS MAY LEAD TO THOSE STATES ATTAINING THIS STATUS, GAINING UNINTENDED LEGAL AND DIPLOMATIC BENEFITS, AND THREATENING THE LONG-TERM EFFICACY OF THE GLOBAL NONPROLIFERATION REGIME.","COLUMBIA UNIV, SCHOOL LAW, 435 W 116TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10027 USA","COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY",NA,NA,"2022-11-29","OJ3JX",NA,NA,"1945-2268",NA,NA,"0010-1958","COLUMBIA LAW REV.","COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW","ENGLISH","MAY","162","4",NA,"1035-1076","COLUMBIA JOURNAL TRANSNATIONAL LAW ASSOC","GOVERNMENT \& LAW",0,"TOWARD A NUCLEAR RECOGNITION THRESHOLD","ARTICLE","WOS000583862400006","0","2","120","LAW","SOCIAL SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (SSCI)",2020,"MISHRA, R (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), COLUMBIA LAW SCH, NEW YORK, NY 10027 USA","ISI","COLUMBIA LAW SCH;COLUMBIA LAW SCH","COLUMBIA LAW SCH","MISHRA R, 2020, COLUMBIA LAW REV","MISHRA R, 2020, COLUMBIA LAW REV","USA",1,0

IN THIS ARTICLE, WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER SITUATIONS OF EXTENDED DETERRENCE IN WHICH A NUCLEAR PATRON MAKES A DEFENSIVE COMMITMENT TO A NONNUCLEAR CLIENT STATE CAN INADVERTENTLY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A CLIENT WILL INITIATE A CRISIS WITH ANOTHER STATE. USING DATA ON THE CRISIS BEHAVIOR OF STATES FROM 1950 TO 2000, WE ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF A NUCLEAR UMBRELLA ON VARIOUS CRISIS OUTCOMES, INCLUDING THE INITIATION AND ESCALATION OF MILITARIZED CONFLICT. INTERESTINGLY, WE FIND NO EVIDENCE THAT SUCH COMMITMENTS INCREASE THE RISK OF WAR OR EVEN TWO-SIDED VIOLENCE AT LOWER LEVELS. HOWEVER, CONSISTENT WITH BOTH THE MORAL HAZARD LOGIC AND BARGAINING THEORIES OF WAR, WE SHOW THAT THIS APPEARS TO BE BECAUSE POTENTIAL TARGET STATES OFFER INCREASED POLICY CONCESSIONS TO CLIENT STATES TO AVOID COSTLY FIGHTING. THUS, THE LINK BETWEEN NUCLEAR UMBRELLAS AND MORAL HAZARD APPEARS TO BE REAL, BUT IT IS REFLECTED IN THE DIVISION OF BENEFITS RATHER THAN A GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF WAR.

URANIUM ENRICHMENT DETERMINATION IS TYPICALLY ACHIEVED BY MEASURING THE RATIO OF CHARACTERISTIC GAMMA-RAY EMISSIONS FROM U-235 AND U-238. FISSION ALSO PRODUCES BETA-DELAYED NEUTRONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN USED IN THE PAST TO DETERMINE URANIUM ENRICHMENT FROM THE TIME DEPENDENCE OF THE LONG-LIVED DELAYED-NEUTRON EMISSION RATE. SUCH MEASUREMENTS TYPICALLY USE MODERATED HE-3-TUBE DETECTORS. WE DEMONSTRATE AN ALTERNATIVE MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE THAT EMPLOYS A FAST NEUTRON ACTIVE-INTERROGATION PROBE AND A SCINTILLATION DETECTOR TO MEASURE THE ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM USING BOTH THE BUILDUP AND DECAY OF BETA-DELAYED-NEUTRON EMISSION. INSTEAD OF HE-3 TUBES, A CAPTURE-BASED HETEROGENEOUS COMPOSITE DETECTOR CONSISTING OF SCINTILLATING LI GLASS AND POLYVINYL TOLUENE IS CONSTRUCTED AND USED, OFFERING A PROSPECT TO SCALE DELAYED-NEUTRON MEASUREMENTS TO LARGER DETECTOR SIZES. SINCE THE TECHNIQUE RELIES ON THE EXISTING TABULATED NUCLEAR DATA, NO CALIBRATION STANDARDS ARE REQUIRED. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE BUILDUP OF DELAYED-NEUTRON EMISSION CAN BE USED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN URANIUM SAMPLES AND INFER THE URANIUM ENRICHMENT LEVEL, WITH ACCURACY THAT RIVALS THE METHOD THAT EMPLOYS THE TIME-DEPENDENT DECAY OF DELAYED-NEUTRON EMISSION.","ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA","UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN; PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE); PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY; PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY - UNIVERSITY PARK; PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE); PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY; PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY - UNIVERSITY PARK","024049","JTNATT@UMICH.EDU","2022-11-29","GS0BL","10.1103/PhysRevApplied.10.024049",NA,NA,"U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY [2014-DN-077-ARI078-02, 2015-DN-077-ARI096]; CONSORTIUM FOR VERIFICATION TECHNOLOGY UNDER U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION AWARD [DE-NA0002534]; NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL SAFEGUARDS [NA-241]","THE AUTHORS THANK J.

HOWEVER, THE TRANSPORT OF IODINE THROUGH INTACT GEOLOGIC MEDIA IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD, COMPROMISING OUR ABILITY TO ASSESS RISK ASSOCIATED WITH RADIOIODINE MIGRATION. THE CURRENT STUDY'S GOAL IS TO QUANTIFY THE MATRIX DIFFUSION OF IODINE SPECIES THROUGH SATURATED VOLCANIC ROCK, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION PAID TO THE REDOX ENVIRONMENT AND POTENTIAL SPECIATION CHANGES. DIFFUSION EXPERIMENTS WERE RUN FOR IODIDE THROUGH LITHOPHYSAE-RICH LAVA, LITHOPHYSAE-POOR LAVA, AND WELDED TUFF, WHEREAS IODATE DIFFUSION WAS STUDIED THROUGH WELDED TUFF. IODINE TRANSPORT WAS COMPARED WITH A CONSERVATIVE TRACER, HDO, AND EFFECTIVE DIFFUSION COEFFICIENTS WERE CALCULATED. LIKELY DUE TO A COMBINATION OF SIZE AND ANION EXCLUSION EFFECTS, IODINE SPECIES DIFFUSED MORE SLOWLY THAN THE CONSERVATIVE TRACER THROUGH ALL ROCK TYPES TESTED. FURTHERMORE, OXIDATION OF IODIDE TO IODATE WAS OBSERVED IN THE LITHOPHYSAE-POOR LAVA, AFFECTING TRANSPORT. RESULTS PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED DATA FOR SUBSURFACE TRANSPORT MODELS THAT PREDICT RADIOIODINE MIGRATION FROM UNDERGROUND SOURCES, AND INDICATE THE PRESSING NEED FOR GEOCHEMICAL AND REDOX INTERACTIONS TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THESE MODELS.","RADARWEG 29A, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY","103714","CWNEIL@LANL.GOV","2022-11-29","OZ8KU","10.1016/j.jconhyd.2020.103714",NA,"1873-6009","NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION OF U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY [89233218CNA000001]; LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY; NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, DEFENSE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (NNSA DNN RD); U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY","WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK GEORGE PERKINS AND THOM RAHN FOR THEIR HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF HDO SAMPLES.

WITHOUT ACCURATE TRANSPORT MODELS, IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN XENON SIGNATURES ORIGINATING FROM CIVILIAN NUCLEAR FACILITIES AND UNES. UNDERSTANDING XENON TRANSPORT TIME THROUGH THE EARTH IS A KEY PARAMETER FOR INTERPRETING MEASURED XENON ISOTOPIC RATIOS. ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECTS OF MODELING GAS TRANSPORT TIME IS ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECT OF VARIABLE WATER SATURATION OF GEOLOGICAL MEDIA. IN THIS STUDY, WE UTILIZE BENCH-SCALE LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS TO CHARACTERIZE THE DIFFUSION OF KRYPTON, XENON, AND SULFUR HEXAFLUORIDE (SF6) THROUGH INTACT ZEOLITIC TUFF UNDER DIFFERENT SATURATIONS. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE WATER IN ROCK CORES WITH LOW PARTIAL SATURATION DRAMATICALLY AFFECTS XENON TRANSPORT TIME COMPARED TO THAT OF KRYPTON AND SF6 BY BLOCKING SITES IN ZEOLITIC TUFF THAT PREFERENTIALLY ADSORB XENON. THIS LEADS TO BREAKTHROUGH TRENDS THAT ARE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE DEGREE OF THE ROCK SATURATION. XENON IS ESPECIALLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS PHENOMENON, A FINDING THAT IS CRUCIAL TO INCORPORATE IN SUBSURFACE GAS TRANSPORT MODELS USED FOR NUCLEAR EVENT IDENTIFICATION. WE ALSO FIND THAT THE BREAKTHROUGH OF SF6 DIVERGES SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THAT OF NOBLE GASES WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. WHEN DEVELOPING FIELD SCALE MODELS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE BEHAVIOR OF XENON DEVIATES FROM CHEMICAL TRACERS USED IN THE FIELD, SUCH AS SF6 (CARRIGAN ET AL., 1996). THESE NEW INSIGHTS DEMONSTRATE THE CRITICAL NEED TO CONSIDER THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN ROCK SATURATION AND FISSION PRODUCT SORPTION DURING TRANSPORT MODELING, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF EVALUATING SPECIFIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN GEOMEDIA AND GASES OF INTEREST, WHICH MAY DIFFER FROM GEOMEDIA INTERACTIONS WITH CHEMICAL TRACERS.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY; JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES; UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF MARYLAND; UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND COLLEGE PARK; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS \& TECHNOLOGY (NIST) - USA; DUKE UNIVERSITY","106905","CWNEIL@LANL.GOV","2022-11-29","3I4NE","10.1016/j.jenvrad.2022.106905",NA,"1879-1700","NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, DEFENSE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (NNSA DNN RD); DEFENSE THREAT REDUCTION AGENCY (DTRA); NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION OF U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY [89233218CNA000001]; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY.

METHODS THAT CAN DETECT AND IDENTIFY SPECIAL NUCLEAR MATERIAL (SNM) EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF SHIELDING ARE THEREFORE OF HIGH VALUE IN MANY NUCLEAR SECURITY AND NONPROLIFERATION APPLICATIONS. IT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY SHOWN THAT THE BUILDUP AND DECAY TIME PROFILES OF LONGLIVED DELAYED NEUTRON EMISSION FROM INDUCED FISSION ARE UNIQUE AND CAN BE USED TO SUCCESSFULLY DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN URANIUM ISOTOPES AND INFER ENRICHMENT WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A CALIBRATION STANDARD. BECAUSE THE LONGLIVED DELAYED NEUTRON PRECURSORS EXHIBIT DECAY TIMES ON THE ORDER OF TENS OF SECONDS, THEIR TIME PROFILES ARE NOT SENSITIVE TO THE DELAYS ASSOCIATED WITH SCATTERING OR DIFFUSION IN SHIELDING MATERIALS, WHICH OCCUR ON MUCH SHORTER TIME SCALES. THE USE OF CAPTURE-BASED NEUTRON DETECTORS CAN ALSO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF SHIELDING, BECAUSE UNLIKE RECOIL-BASED DETECTORS, THEY DO NOT HAVE A LOW-ENERGY DETECTION THRESHOLD, SO THAT NEUTRONS THAT LOSE THEIR ENERGY IN THE SHIELDING ARE STILL DETECTABLE. IN THIS WORK, THE EFFECTS OF LOW-Z SHIELDING ON THE DISCRIMINATION OF URANIUM ISOTOPES USING DELAYED NEUTRON TIME PROFILE MEASUREMENTS ARE INVESTIGATED FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE DELAYED NEUTRON BUILDUP AND DECAY TIME PROFILES OF POLYETHYLENE-SHIELDED HEU AND DEPLETED URANIUM OBJECTS ARE MEASURED USING TWO DIFFERENT CAPTURE-GATED DETECTOR DESIGNS. THE RECORDED PROFILES SHOW GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE SHAPES PREDICTED FROM SIX-GROUP DELAYED NEUTRON MODELS EVEN WITH THE SHIELDING IN PLACE, AND THE ENRICHMENT OF THE HEU AND DU OBJECTS WAS ESTIMATED ACCURATELY TO WITHIN 5\%. WHILE THIS METHOD SHOWS POTENTIAL FOR DISCRIMINATING AND CHARACTERIZING EXTREME CASES OF ENRICHMENT WHEN A MODERATE AMOUNT OF SHIELDING IS PRESENT, SIMULATION RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS EXIST FOR INTERMEDIATE ENRICHMENT LEVELS DUE TO DISTORTIONS TO THE DELAYED NEUTRON TIME PROFILE CAUSED BY NEUTRON REFLECTION IN THE SHIELDING.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY","165847","KOGREN@UMICH.EDU","2022-11-29","XE9DU","10.1016/j.nima.2021.165847","OCT 2021","1872-9576","CONSORTIUM FOR VERIFICATION TECHNOLOGY AND CONSORTIUM FOR MONITORING, VERIFICATION AND TECHNOLOGY UNDER U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION [DE-NA0002534, DE-NA0003920]","THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO THANK J.

IN THIS EFFORT, WE DEMONSTRATE THE INITIAL COUPLING OF AN ADVION PLATE EXPRESS PLATE READER TO A LIQUID SAMPLING-ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE GLOW DISCHARGE (LS-APGD) MICROPLASMA IONIZATION SOURCE WITH AN ORBITRAP MASS SPECTROMETER TO PERFORM URANIUM ISOTOPIC ANALYSES OF SOLUTION RESIDUES ON COTTON SWIPES. THE PLATE EXPRESS EMPLOYS A SAMPLING PROBE HEAD TO ENGAGE AND SEAL AGAINST THE SWIPE SURFACE. SUBSEQUENTIALLY, THE ANALYTE RESIDUES ARE DESORBED AND TRANSPORTED WITHIN A 2\% HNO3 ELECTROLYTE FLOW TO THE IONIZATION SOURCE. QUANTITATIVE RECOVERIES WERE OBSERVED FOLLOWING A SINGLE 30 S EXTRACTION STEP, WITH THE ABSOLUTE MASS SAMPLED PER EXTRACTION BEING SIMILAR TO 100 NG. WHILE THE INTRASAMPLE VARIABILITY IN THE ANALYTICAL RESPONSES FOR TRIPLICATE SAMPLING OF THE SAME SWIPE YIELD SIMILAR TO 30\% RSD, THIS LACK OF PRECISION IS OFFSET BY THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE ISOTOPE RATIOS FOR ENRICHED URANIUM SPECIMENS WITH A PRECISION OF BETTER THAN 10\% RSD.

WHILE TECHNOLOGIES EXIST FOR ENVIRONMENTAL U DETECTION, WIDE-AREA ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, I.E. SAMPLING COVERAGE OVER LARGE AREAS NOT KNOWN TO POSSESS U CONTAMINATION, REMAINS A CHALLENGING PROSPECT THAT NECESSITATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL DETECTION APPROACHES. HEREIN, WE DESCRIBE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A WHOLE-CELL U SENSOR BY INTEGRATING TWO FUNCTIONALLY INDEPENDENT, NATIVE U-RESPONSIVE TWO-COMPONENT SIGNALING SYSTEMS (TCS), UZCRS AND URPRS, WITHIN AN AND GATE CIRCUIT IN THE BACTERIUM CAULOBACTER CRESCENTUS. THROUGH LEVERAGE OF THE DISTINCT BUT IMPERFECT SELECTIVITY PROFILES OF BOTH TCS, THIS COMBINATORIAL APPROACH ENABLED GREATER SELECTIVITY RELATIVE TO A PRIOR BIOSENSOR DEVELOPED WITH UZCRS ALONE; NO CROSS-REACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED WITH MOST COMMON ENVIRONMENTAL METALS (E.G, FE, AS, CU, CA, MG, CD, CR, AL) OR THE U DECAY-CHAIN PRODUCT TH, AND THE SELECTIVITY AGAINST ZN AND PB WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. IN ADDITION, INTEGRATION OF THE UZCRS SIGNAL AMPLIFIER PROTEIN UZCY WITHIN THE AND GATE CIRCUIT FURTHER ENHANCED OVERALL SENSITIVITY AND SELECTIVITY FOR U. THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SENSOR IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT WAS CONFIRMED BY DETECTION OF U CONCENTRATIONS AS LOW AS 1 MU M IN GROUNDWATER SAMPLES. THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE VALUE OF A COMBINATORIAL APPROACH FOR CONSTRUCTING WHOLE-CELL SENSORS FOR THE SELECTIVE DETECTION OF ANALYTES FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO KNOWN EVOLVED REGULATORS.","1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY",NA,"PARK36@LLNL.GOV","2022-11-29","HU7UA","10.1021/acssynbio.8b00484",NA,NA,"U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY BY LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY [DE-AC52-07NA27344 (LLNL-JRNL-760180)]; LABORATORY DIRECTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AT LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY (LDRD) [16-LW-055]","WE THANK MIMI YUNG, K.

THIS IS WIDELY REGARDED AS A LAMENTABLE FACT, AS STATES CAN PURSUE NUCLEAR WEAPONS UNDER THE GUISE OF PEACEFUL INTENTIONS. HOWEVER, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES AN UPSIDE TO THE NUCLEAR DUAL-USE DILEMMA: THE DENIABLE NATURE OF DUAL-USE TECHNOLOGY MAKES IT MORE AMENABLE TO COERCIVE COUNTERPROLIFERATION. CAUGHT PROLIFERATORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE IF THEY CAN ELUDE AUDIENCE COSTS BY DENYING THAT THEY WERE EVER OUT OF COMPLIANCE. THUS, THE DUAL-USE DILEMMA IS BOTH THE BANE OF THE NONPROLIFERATION REGIME AND A BOON TO ITS COERCIVE ENFORCEMENT. POOR KNOWLEDGE OF PAST NUCLEAR PROGRAMS CAN HAMPER FUTURE VERIFICATION. COUNTERINTUITIVELY, HOWEVER, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NONPROLIFERATION REGIME INSTITUTIONS CREATED TO PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY-THE TREATY ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY (IAEA)-MAY BE ENHANCED BY NOT DIRECTLY CHALLENGING THE DENIAL OF PAST NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES. THIS RESEARCH USES INTERVIEWS AND ARCHIVAL EVIDENCE FROM THE IAEA, US GOVERNMENT, AND SOUTH AFRICAN APARTHEID GOVERNMENT. AT A TIME WHEN ONGOING NUCLEAR DISPUTES REVOLVE AROUND QUESTIONS OF TRANSPARENCY AND ADMISSIONS OF GUILT, THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO SCHOLARLY AND POLICY DEBATES ABOUT SECRECY, FACE-SAVING, COUNTERPROLIFERATION STRATEGY, AND THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN COERCIVE BARGAINING.","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","BROWN UNIVERSITY; BROWN UNIVERSITY",NA,NA,"2022-11-29","0Z9GU","10.1093/isq/sqab036","MAY 2021","1468-2478",NA,NA,"0020-8833","INT.

THIS TREATY ENTERED-INTO-FORCE IN 1997 AND HAS A NEARLY UNIVERSAL MEMBERSHIP OF WORLD STATES. THE CWC PROVIDES DEFINITIONS FOR WHAT CONSTITUTES A CHEMICAL WEAPON AND DESCRIBES CHEMICALS FOR WHICH VERIFICATION MEASURES AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT ARE REQUIRED. THESE CHEMICALS, WHICH MUST BE DECLARED TO THE ORGANISATION FOR THE PROHIBITION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS FOR VERIFICATION PURPOSES, APPEAR IN THREE SCHEDULES WITHIN THE CWC. THE SCHEDULES LIST SPECIFIC CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES AND FAMILIES OF CHEMICALS DEFINED BY MOLECULAR STRUCTURE DESCRIPTIONS THAT ALLOW A RANGE OF SPECIFIED VARIABLE GROUPS. THE TEXT OF AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY PROVIDES A BASIS FOR LAWS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AT INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS THAT MUST BE ENACTED T , COMPLY WITH TREATY OBLIGATIONS. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MUST ACCOUNT FOR THE ``CHEMISTRY'' THAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE TREATY TEXT, WHICH HAS BEEN NEGOTIATED AND AGREED UPON BY WORLD GOVERNMENTS. IN THIS PAPER, WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE CHEMICALS DESCRIBED WITHIN THE CWC AND DISCUSS HOW ATOMS AND MOLECULES, NOMENCLATURE, AND CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE NUMBERS, ISOMER ENUMERATION, RING STRAIN, AND STEREOCHEMISTRY INFLUENCE THE OBLIGATIONS OF STATES TO AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY. THE MATERIAL DRAWS UPON THE AUTHORS' EXPERIENCES FROM AN INTERACTIVE ``SCIENCE FOR DIPLOMATS'' INITIATIVE THAT HAS PROVIDED A FORUM FOR ENGAGING WITH CHEMICAL DISARMAMENT DECISION-MAKERS TO AID IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS IN CHEMISTRY THAT HAVE AN IMPACT ON TREATY IMPLEMENTATION. WE HOPE THIS ARTICLE WILL SPARK INTEREST FROM CHEMISTRY STUDENTS AND EDUCATORS IN THE PROVISION OF SCIENCE ADVICE FOR POLICYMAKERS AND PROVIDE POLICYMAKERS WITH AN APPRECIATION OF THE COMPLEXITY AND IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING THE LANGUAGE OF CHEMISTRY IN SUPPORT OF A WORLD FREE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.","1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); PACIFIC NORTHWEST NATIONAL LABORATORY; DEFENCE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY LABORATORY",NA,"JONATHAN.FORMAN@PNNL.GOV","2022-11-29","MO3ED","10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00547",NA,"1938-1328",NA,NA,"0021-9584","J.

IN THIS STUDY, COMBINATIONS OF PU, CS, AND BA ISOTOPE RATIOS THAT PRODUCE POSITION (IN THE REACTOR CORE) INDEPENDENT MONITORS OF IRRADIATION HISTORY IN SPENT LIGHT WATER REACTOR FUEL ARE IDENTIFIED AND EXPLORED. THESE POSITION INDEPENDENT MONITORS (PIMS) ARE MODELED FOR VARIOUS IRRADIATION SCENARIOS USING AUTOMATED DEPLETION CODES AS WELL AS ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION SOLUTIONS TO APPROXIMATE NUCLEAR PHYSICS MODELS. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION WAS PERFORMED USING IRRADIATED LOW ENRICHED URANIUM OXIDE FUEL FROM A LIGHT WATER REACTOR, WHICH WAS SAMPLED AT 8 AXIAL POSITIONS FROM A SINGLE ROD. PLUTONIUM, BARIUM AND CESIUM WERE CHEMICALLY SEPARATED AND ISOTOPE RATIO MEASUREMENTS OF THE SEPARATED SOLUTIONS WERE MADE BY QUADRUPOLE AND MULTI-COLLECTOR INDUCTIVELY COUPLED MASS SPECTROMETRY (CS AND PU, RESPECTIVELY) AND THERMAL IONIZATION MASS SPECTROMETRY (BA). THE EFFECT OF AXIAL VARIATIONS IN NEUTRON FLUENCE AND ENERGY SPECTRUM ARE EVIDENT IN THE MEASURED ISOTOPE RATIOS. TWO VERSIONS OF A COMBINED PU AND CS BASED PIM ARE DEVELOPED. A LINEAR PIM MODEL, WHICH CAN BE USED TO SOLVE FOR IRRADIATION TIME IS FOUND TO WORK WELL FOR NATURAL U FUEL WITH < 10\% PU-240 AND KNOWN OR SHORT COOLING TIMES. A NON-LINEAR PIM MODEL, WHICH CANNOT BE SOLVED EXPLICITLY FOR IRRADIATION TIME WITHOUT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, CAN NONETHELESS STILL GROUP SAMPLES BY IRRADIATION HISTORY, INCLUDING HIGH BURNUP LEU FUEL WITH UNKNOWN COOLING TIME. BA-132/BA-138 IS ALSO OBSERVED TO ACT AS A POSITION INDEPENDENT MONITOR; IT IS NEARLY SINGLE VALUED ACROSS THE SAMPLED FUEL ROD, INDICATING THAT SAMPLES SHARING AN IRRADIATION HISTORY (SAME IRRADIATION TIME AND COOLING TIME) IN A REACTOR DESPITE EXPERIENCING DIFFERENT NEUTRON FLUXES WILL HAVE A COMMON BA-132/BA-138 RATIO. MODELING OF THIS BA PIM SHOWS IT INCREASES MONOTONICALLY WITH IRRADIATION AND COOLING TIME, AND A CONFIRMATORY FIRST ORDER ANALYTICAL SOLUTION IS ALSO PRESENTED.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY; UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF GEORGIA; GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); IDAHO NATIONAL LABORATORY",NA,"ROBELL@LLNL.GOV","2022-11-29","HA3FG","10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.08.014",NA,"1879-1700","U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY BY LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY [DE-AC52-07NA27344]","THIS WORK WAS PERFORMED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY BY LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY UNDER CONTRACT DE-AC52-07NA27344.","0265-931X","J.

DESPITE THIS NOTABLE PROGRESS, ADVANCES IN CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS BRING NEW CHALLENGES TO PREVENTING CHEMICAL WEAPONS PRODUCTION. THE DEVELOPMENT OF ETHICAL CODES OR GUIDELINES SUCH AS THE HAGUE ETHICAL GUIDELINES AND THE GLOBAL CHEMISTS' CODE OF ETHICS (GCCE) AND THEIR VOLUNTARY ADOPTION BY CHEMICAL PRACTITIONERS WORLDWIDE ARE IMPORTANT STEPS IN STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL NONPROLIFERATION EFFORTS THROUGH THEIR POTENTIAL TO IMPACT THE INTENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL BY NORMALIZING ETHICAL BEHAVIOR. HOWEVER, THE SIMPLE ACT OF ADOPTING A CODE OR IMPLEMENTING RESPONSIBLE CARE INITIATIVES DOES NOT GUARANTEE ETHICAL BEHAVIOR. INDIVIDUALS' DECISIONS OFTEN CONTRIBUTE TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF CHEMICAL INCIDENTS AND ACCIDENTS, EVEN IF THE ROOT CAUSES ARE SHORTFALLS IN SAFETY AND/OR SECURITY. HISTORY IS REPLETE WITH ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL INCIDENTS THAT WERE MADE WORSE DUE TO ETHICS FAILURES AT THE INDIVIDUAL AND/OR CORPORATE LEVEL. THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONSE AND ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATIONS FOR SUCH INCIDENTS CAN BE MASSIVE, BUT KNEE-JERK REACTIONS TO PUSH FOR MORE REGULATION OR TO ESTABLISH MORE OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS FOLLOWING THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT AND INITIAL CLEANUP MAY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RESOURCES TO EXECUTE. AT THEIR CORE, ETHICS FAILURES OFTEN ARISE, AT LEAST PARTIALLY, DUE TO A LACK OF SHARED INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY'S MISSION. WHEN PEOPLE ARE GUIDED BY A SHARED MISSION, THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BRING A SENSE OF PROFESSIONALISM TO THEIR WORK AND TO HOLD EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE FOR ETHICAL BEHAVIOR. SCENARIO-BASED TRAINING CAN PROVIDE NEW EMPLOYEES OPPORTUNITIES TO PRACTICE ACTING ETHICALLY, BUT IT TAKES TIME AND MONEY TO ORGANIZE IN-PERSON TRAINING EVENTS. CAREFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SCENARIO-BASED E-LEAMING TO TEACH BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS THAT COMPEL TRAINEES TO PRACTICE AND DISCUSS ETHICS, HOWEVER, CAN PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL WAY TO ENSURE EMPLOYEES ARE PROVIDED THE NECESSARY OPPORTUNITIES TO REHEARSE ETHICAL BEHAVIOR, REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ARE PHYSICALLY LOCATED. AS INDIVIDUALS BECOME COMFORTABLE IDENTIFYING AND STANDING UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT, THEY STRENGTHEN THEIR RESOLVE TO ACT WHEN ISSUES ARISE IN THE FUTURE. COMPANY MANAGERS AND UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS ALIKE HAVE A DUTY TO EDUCATE OTHERS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR, CAPITALIZE ON TEACHABLE MOMENTS TO HELP OTHERS UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE DESIRED BEHAVIORS, ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO SPEAK UP AND ACT WHEN THEY SEE SOMETHING WRONG, AND MODEL THE BEHAVIORS THEY SEEK. IN SO DOING, THEY MAY ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE AND MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR THE REEMERGENCE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.","1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); PACIFIC NORTHWEST NATIONAL LABORATORY; AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY",NA,"KABRENA.RODDA@PNNL.GOV","2022-11-29","MO3ED","10.1021/acs.jchemed.9b00940",NA,"1938-1328","US OFFICE OF COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION WITHIN THE US STATE DEPARTMENT'S BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND NONPROLIFERATION; DEFENSE THREAT REDUCTION AGENCY","THE AUTHORS GRATEFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE CHEMICAL SECURITY PROGRAM, MANAGED BY THE US OFFICE OF COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION WITHIN THE US STATE DEPARTMENT'S BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND NONPROLIFERATION AS WELL AS THE DEFENSE THREAT REDUCTION AGENCY FOR FUNDING CRAFTING OF THE GCCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE CORRESPONDING E-LEARNING MODULE.

THESE DETECTORS OFFER BROAD APPLICATIONS SUCH AS HOMELAND SECURITY, NONPROLIFERATION, NUCLEAR SECURITY, MEDICAL IMAGING, ASTROPHYSICS, AND HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS. ALL THESE APPLICATIONS DEMAND HIGH-RESOLUTION DETECTORS OPERABLE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND AVAILABLE AT A REASONABLE COST. CDZNTE (CZT) IS THE MATERIAL OF CHOICE FOR THIS PURPOSE; HOWEVER, THE MATERIAL STILL SUFFERS FROM INTRINSIC DEFECTS SUCH AS HIGHLY DECORATED SUBGRAIN BOUNDARY NETWORKS AND A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF SECONDARY PHASES. THESE DEFECTS NOT ONLY HINDER THE CHARGE TRANSPORT BUT ALSO CREATE A SPATIAL INHOMOGENEITY IN THE CHARGE TRANSPORT PROPERTIES, SUBSEQUENTLY CAUSING SUBSTANTIAL DEGRADATION IN DETECTOR RESPONSE PARTICULARLY FOR RELATIVELY THICK (>1CM) DETECTORS. SOME OF THE MATERIAL DEFICIENCIES SUFFERED BY CZT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED BY ADDING SELENIUM INTO THE CZT MATRIX.

THE REACTOR DESIGN IN QUESTION IS THE RBMK, AND THIS PAPER WILL ARGUE THAT THIS DESIGN WAS FAR FROM ``CHEAP,'' NEITHER THEN NOR NOW, AND THAT ITS ADOPTION AS THE SECOND STANDARD DESIGN FOR THE SOVIET UNION'S NUCLEAR POWER REACTOR FLEET WAS BASED ON MUCH MORE THAN ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS. WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT, IT IS EASY TO FORGET THAT REACTOR DESIGNS ARE ALWAYS CHOSEN FOR A MULTITUDE OF REASONS AND NEVER SOLELY BASED ON THEIR TECHNICAL OR ECONOMIC MERITS. BASED ON ARCHIVAL RESEARCH, INTERVIEWS, AND INDUSTRY PUBLICATIONS, I SHOW THAT APPROVING AND BUILDING RBMK REACTORS MADE GOOD SENSE AT THE TIME, DESPITE LATER CLAIMS TO THE CONTRARY. THEN I TAKE THE EXAMPLES OF A SMALL MODULAR REACTOR (SMR), THE PROPOSED NUSCALE POWER MODULE, AND A FAST NEUTRON REACTOR, TERRAPOWER'S PROPOSED TRAVELING WAVE REACTOR, TO ARGUE THAT WE WITNESS COMPARABLE NEGOTIATIONS TODAY, AS NEW DESIGNS FOR REACTORS (1) ATTEMPT TO FIT INTO EXISTING SAFETY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS, (2) NAVIGATE SECURITY AND NONPROLIFERATION CONCERNS, AND (3) EMBODY VISIONS OF A SPECIFIC SOCIOTECHNICAL ORDER. I CONCLUDE THAT TECHNICAL DESIGNS NEVER OCCUR IN A SOCIOECONOMIC, POLITICAL, OR CULTURAL VACUUM; INSTEAD, THEY ARE DEVELOPED BY PEOPLE STEEPED IN SOCIAL NORMS, REGULATORY CONCERNS, AND ECONOMIC EXPECTATIONS OF A SPECIFIC TIME AND PLACE. IN THE SPIRIT OF MAKING THIS POINT RELEVANT TO PRACTITIONERS, I WILL SUGGEST WAYS OF MAKING THESE IMPLICIT FRAMEWORKS VISIBLE, TO ACTIVELY AND CONSCIOUSLY START TWEAKING THEM, WHILE STAYING AWARE OF THE IMPLICATIONS THAT TECHNICAL CHOICES MAY HAVE ON OUR SOCIAL EXPECTATIONS AND VICE VERSA.","530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA","VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE \& STATE UNIVERSITY",NA,"SSCHMID@VT.EDU","2022-11-29","TX2KL","10.1080/00295450.2020.1837584","MAR 2021","1943-7471","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [SES1351575]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [SES1351575].

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES INCLUDE THE FISSILE MASS, LEAKAGE MULTIPLICATION, AND THE ALPHA-RATIO, DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF (ALPHA,N) NEUTRONS TO SPONTANEOUS FISSION NEUTRONS. TRADITIONALLY, THESE PROPERTIES CAN BE INFERRED BY RELATING THE MEASURED NEUTRON MULTIPLICITY COUNT RATES TO THE WELL-ESTABLISHED POINT KINETICS MOMENTS EQUATIONS; THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART UTILIZES HE-3-BASED DETECTION SYSTEMS. ORGANIC SCINTILLATORS HAVE BEEN USED EXTENSIVELY TO STUDY AND MEASURE CHARACTERISTIC SIGNATURES IN THE NEUTRON ANGULAR AND ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS. PREVIOUS WORK HAS PROPOSED TECHNIQUES THAT INDEPENDENTLY LEVERAGE THE ENERGY AND ANGLE SENSITIVITY OF ORGANIC SCINTILLATORS TO ESTIMATE THE ALPHA-RATIO OF PLUTONIUM BEARING MATERIAL; HOWEVER, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE ENERGY AND ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS ARE CORRELATED TO ONE ANOTHER DUE TO THE UNDERLYING PHYSICS OF FISSION AND (ALPHA,N) NEUTRON EMISSIONS. THIS WORK PRESENTS EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS THAT CHARACTERIZE NEUTRON-NEUTRON ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE NEUTRON-NEUTRON ENERGY-ANGLE CORRELATIONS FOR PLUTONIUM SAMPLES OF SIMILAR MASS AND MULTIPLICATION, BUT VARYING ALPHA-RATIO DUE TO THE TYPE OF LOW-Z IMPURITY. FULL NEUTRON-NEUTRON ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS ARE PRESENTED USING A LOW-ENERGY DETECTION THRESHOLD OF 0.10, 0.15, AND 0.20 MEVEE (0.73, 0.96, 1.16 MEV NEUTRON-EQUIVALENT ENERGY). NEUTRON ANISOTROPY WAS QUANTIFIED BY TAKING THE RATIO OF NEUTRON-NEUTRON COINCIDENCES AT 180 DEGREES TO THOSE AT 90 DEGREES, WHERE A VALUE OF UNITY INDICATES A PURELY ISOTROPIC SOURCE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE OBSERVED NEUTRON-NEUTRON CORRELATIONS TRANSITION AWAY FROM FISSION-INDUCED SIGNAL TO THE CROSS-TALK SIGNAL ASSOCIATED WITH SINGLE (ALPHA,N) NEUTRONS WITH INCREASING ALPHA-RATIO. ENERGY-ANGLE CORRELATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY CALCULATING THE NEUTRON ANISOTROPY AT VARIOUS DETECTION THRESHOLDS AND SHOW POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE OBSERVED ANISOTROPY AND THE ENERGY OF THE NEUTRONS.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY","162297","THSHIN@UMICH.EDU","2022-11-29","JX0KX","10.1016/j.nima.2019.06.038",NA,"1872-9576","CONSORTIUM FOR VERIFICATION TECHNOLOGY UNDER DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION [DE-NA0002534]","THIS RESEARCH WAS FUNDED IN-PART BY THE CONSORTIUM FOR VERIFICATION TECHNOLOGY UNDER DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION AWARD DE-NA0002534.

DIVERSION OF UOC FROM THE FUEL CYCLE INTO POSSIBLE WEAPONS PRODUCTION IS A KEY CONCERN IN GLOBAL NONPROLIFERATION EFFORTS. AS SUCH, THE ABILITY TO TRACE THE ORIGIN OF SEIZED NUCLEAR MATERIALS IS IMPERATIVE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS. ALTHOUGH ISOTOPIC SIGNATURES OF UOCS HAVE PROVEN FRUITFUL TO PINPOINT SAMPLE PROVENANCE, NEW ISOTOPIC SIGNATURES ARE NEEDED BECAUSE MOST EXISTING ISOTOPIC SIGNATURES ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF THE ORIGINAL ORE BODY FROM WHICH THE U IS DERIVED. IN THIS WORK, WE DEVELOPED A NEW METHOD TO SEPARATE SAMARIUM (SM) FROM A U-RICH SAMPLE MATRIX AND REPORT THE FIRST SM ISOTOPE COMPOSITIONS OF 32 UOCS DERIVED FROM A VARIETY OF WORLDWIDE URANIUM MINES. RELATIVE TO TERRESTRIAL STANDARDS, APPROXIMATELY HALF THE UOCS HAVE RESOLVED AND ANTICORRELATED 1495M-1505M ISOTOPE COMPOSITIONS, CONSISTENT WITH THE CAPTURE OF THERMAL NEUTRONS BY 1495M IN THE ORE BODY. THE UOCS WITH ANOMALOUS SM ISOTOPE COMPOSITIONS TEND TO DERIVE FROM OLDER ( SIMILAR TO>1.5GA) AND HIGHER-GRADE ORE BODIES, ALTHOUGH OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE PRESENCE OF NEUTRON MODERATORS LIKE WATER, ALSO PLAY A ROLE. NONETHELESS, THE SM ISOTOPE COMPOSITIONS OF UOCS DIRECTLY REFLECTS THE NEUTRON FLUENCE OVER THE HISTORY OF THE ORIGINAL ORE BODY AND CAN BE USED TO DISCERN DIFFERENT GEOLOGIC CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ORE BODY. AS SUCH, THIS WORK DEMONSTRATES THE POTENTIAL USE OF SM ISOTOPES AS A NOVEL NUCLEAR FORENSICS SIGNATURE FOR ORIGIN ASSESSMENT OF UOCS.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF MUNSTER; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY","121431","QSHOLLENBERGER@UCLA.EDU","2022-11-29","OD5RI","10.1016/j.talanta.2020.121431",NA,"1873-3573","DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT (DFG) [440227108]; SOFJA KOVALEVSKAJA AWARD FROM THE HUMBOLDT FOUNDATION; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY BY LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY [DE-AC52-07NA27344, LLNL-JRNL-811552]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY A DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT (DFG) RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP (PROJECT NUMBER 440227108) AND A SOFJA KOVALEVSKAJA AWARD FROM THE HUMBOLDT FOUNDATION (G.A.B.).

THEORETICAL WORK ON NONPROLIFERATION OFTEN POINTS TO SUCH CONSTRAINTS AS AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF NONPROLIFERATION SUCCESS. SOME HAVE ARGUED THAT, ABSENT SUFFICIENT CONSTRAINT, STATES WITH THE DESIRE AND CAPABILITY TO PROLIFERATE WILL DO SO. FACED WITH MORE COSTLY ROUTES TO A WEAPON, STATES SUBJECT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CONSTRAINT MAY ABIDE BY THE TERMS OF THE DEAL. THIS PERSPECTIVE POSES AN IMPORTANT EMPIRICAL QUESTION: DO NONPROLIFERATION AGREEMENTS RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL CONSTRAINT IN PRACTICE? THIS ARTICLE EVALUATES THE EMPIRICAL PREVALENCE OF CONSTRAINTS ARISING FROM NONPROLIFERATION DEALS. DOING SO REQUIRES (1) PROVIDING AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF NUCLEAR PROFICIENCY AND (2) DEVELOPING AN ESTIMATE OF THE COUNTERFACTUAL, NO-AGREEMENT CAPACITY OF STATES THAT RECEIVED SUCH AGREEMENTS. THIS STUDY ADDRESSES BOTH OF THESE POINTS. FIRST, NEW DATA ARE GATHERED TO ESTIMATE PROFICIENCY, IMPROVING UPON EXISTING MEASURES IN THE LITERATURE. SECOND, THE GENERALIZED SYNTHETIC CONTROL METHOD IS APPLIED TO ESTIMATE COUNTERFACTUAL PROFICIENCY LEVELS FOR THE RECIPIENTS OF AGREEMENTS. WITH THIS APPROACH, THE CONSTRAINING EFFECTS OF DEALS THE UNITED STATES IMPLEMENTED WITH JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, AND TAIWAN AND THE DECLARATION OF IGUACU BETWEEN BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA ARE EVALUATED.

OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE OF A U-BASED METALLIC NUCLEAR FUEL CAN BE ACHIEVED BY RETAINING THE HIGHTEMPERATURE, BODY-CENTERED CUBIC (BCC) ALLOTROPE (GAMMA-U) AT ROOM TEMPERATURE, WHICH CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE U10MO ALLOY. HOWEVER, PRESENCE OF MINOR ALLOYING ELEMENTS CAN INFLUENCE THE FINAL CONSTITUTION OF ROOM-TEMPERATURE PHASES IN THE U10MO ALLOY, SPECIFICALLY, FORMATION OF ALPHA-U PHASE WHICH RESULTS IN ANISOTROPIC BEHAVIOR OF THE FUEL IN REACTOR. THROUGH A DETAILED TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY ANALYSIS, THE PRESENT STUDY REPORTS THE CONSTITUENT PHASES THAT ARE PRESENT IN A U10MO ALLOY CONTAINING SIMILAR TO 0.1 WT\% SI AFTER IT IS SUBJECTED TO HOMOGENIZATION HEAT TREATMENT AND THERMOMECHANICAL PROCESSING. FOR COMPARISON, RESULTS FROM AN UNDOPED U10MO ALLOY ARE ALSO INCLUDED. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS REVEAL THAT GAMMA-UMO SOLID SOLUTION IS THE MAJOR PHASE IN A HOT-ROLLED, SI-DOPED U10MO ALLOY METALLIC FUEL FOIL, ALONG WITH U2MOSI2C, UC, AND U2MO, AFTER ISOTHERMAL ANNEALING AT 460 DEGREES C FOR 10 H. IN CONTRAST, AFTER THE SAME HEAT TREATMENT, THE UNDOPED U10MO ALLOY METALLIC FUEL HAD FORMED A NOTICEABLE AMOUNT OF ALPHA-U ALONG PRIOR GAMMA-UMO GRAIN BOUNDARIES THROUGH DISCONTINUOUS PRECIPITATION (DP, AREA FRACTION: SIMILAR TO 27.9 \%) WITH CHARACTERISTIC LAMELLAR MORPHOLOGY, TOGETHER WITH GAMMA-UMO, UC, AND U2MO. THIS RESULT INDICATES THAT DOPING WITH SI COULD MITIGATE THE DP REACTION IN U10MO ALLOY AND PREVENT FORMATION OF UNDESIRABLE ALPHA-U. THIS WORK SHEDS LIGHT ON OPTIMIZING SI-DOPING-DOMINATED MICROSTRUCTURE IN U10MO FUELS AND FACILITATES DESIGNING AND TUNING OF MICROSTRUCTURES OF U10MO ALLOYS FOR TAILORING THE FINAL DESIGNED PERFORMANCE OF THE FUEL UNDER IRRADIATION.

MANY OF THESE SCHEMES RELY ON SETS OF PREVIOUSLY GENERATED SOLUTIONS (SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS ``GENERATIONS'') TO INFORM FUTURE DECISIONS. WHILE IT IS IMPORTANT TO BUILD UPON PRIOR KNOWLEDGE, THIS PROCESS REQUIRES A FULL GENERATION OF SOLUTIONS TO BE FORMED BEFORE FUTURE SOLUTIONS CAN BE EXAMINED. RATHER THAN RELYING ON A GENERATIONAL SCHEME TO PERFORM AN OPTIMIZATION, WE PROPOSE USING AN AGENT-BASED APPROACH IN CONJUNCTION WITH A BLACKBOARD FRAMEWORK FOR PERFORMING REACTOR DESIGN OPTIMIZATIONS. UTILIZING AN AGENT-BASED APPROACH ALLOWS AGENTS TO PERFORM TASKS INDEPENDENTLY, WHILE RETAINING THE ABILITY TO BUILD OFF OF PREVIOUS SOLUTIONS. WE DEVELOP AN AGENT-BASED BLACKBOARD SYSTEM (ABBS) FOR DETERMINING THE PARETO FRONT (PF) IN SODIUM FAST REACTOR DESIGN OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS AND COMPARED THIS WITH THE NON-DOMINATED SORTING GENETIC ALGORITHM II (NSGA-II). OUR GOAL IS TO EVALUATE THE VIABILITY OF THE ABBS IN PRODUCING A PF THAT IS COMPARABLE WITH THE NSGA-II ALGORITHM. THE DESIGN SPACE CONSISTS OF THE FUEL HEIGHT, FUEL SMEAR, AND PLUTONIUM FRACTION IN THE CORE, AND WE SEEK TO MINIMIZE THE REACTIVITY SWING AND PLUTONIUM MASS, WHILE MAXIMIZING THE BURNUP. THE DIVERSITY, COVERAGE, AND SPREAD OF THE PFS GENERATED BY THE TWO METHODS ARE EXAMINED, AND THE ABBS IS ABLE TO CONVERGE TO THE SAME PF AS THE NSGA-II ALGORITHM. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ABBS IS ABLE TO FIND OPTIMAL DESIGNS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND BY THE NSGA-II ALGORITHM. WE CONCLUDE OUR STUDY BY APPLYING THE ABBS TO THE DESIGN OF A SODIUM-COOLED FAST REACTOR TO DISPOSE OF WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM. THE ABBS FINDS A CORE DESIGN THAT CAN BURN UPWARDS OF 17.5 KG OF WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM PER YEAR AND DEGRADE AN ADDITIONAL 195 KG OF WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM PER YEAR INTO NON-WEAPONS-GRADE MATERIAL.","530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA","UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); IDAHO NATIONAL LABORATORY; OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY",NA,"RYAN.STEWART@INL.GOV","2022-11-29","0H5GJ","10.1080/00295450.2021.1960783","NOV 2021","1943-7471",NA,NA,"0029-5450","NUCL.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A CORRELATIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED OF SET2,3 MEASURED FROM GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES OF DIAGNOSTIC TUMOR (AGILENT MICROARRAYS) IN 379 WOMEN WITH CSTAGE II-III BREAST CANCER FROM THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS ONCOLOGY GROUP Z1031 NEOADJUVANT AROMATASE INHIBITOR TRIAL SET2,3 WAS DICHOTOMIZED USING THE PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED CUTOFF. FISHER EXACT TEST WAS USED TO ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SET2,3 AND LOW PROLIFERATION AT WEEK 2-4 [KI67 \& LE; 10\% OR COMPLETE CELL-CYCLE ARREST (CCCA; KI67 \& LE; 2.7\%)] AND PEPI-0 RATE IN COHORT B, AND THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SET2,3 AND YPSTAGE 0/I IN ALL PATIENTS. COX MODELS WERE USED TO ASSESS EFS WITH RESPECT TO SET2,3 EXCLUDING COHORT B PATIENTS WHO SWITCHED TO CHEMOTHERAPY. RESULTS: PATIENTS WITH HIGH SET2,3 HAD HIGHER RATE OF PHARMA-CODYNAMIC RESPONSE THAN PATIENTS WITH LOW SET2,3 (KI67 \& LE; 10\% IN 88.2\% VS. 56.9\%, P < 0.0001; CCCA IN 50.0\% VS. 26.2\%, P = 0.0054), BUT RATE OF YPSTAGE 0/I (24.0\% VS. 20.4\%, P = 0.4580) OR PEPI = 0 (28.4\% VS. 20.6\%, P = 0.3419) WAS NOT DIFFERENT. PATIENTS WITH HIGH SET2,3 HAD LONGER EFS THAN PATIENTS WITH LOW SET2,3 (HR, 0.52, 95\% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: 0.34-0.80; P = 0.0026). CONCLUSIONS: THIS EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF Z1031 DATA DEMON-STRATED A HIGHER RATE OF PHARMACODYNAMIC SUPPRESSION OF PROLIFER-ATION AND LONGER EFS IN HIGH SET2,3 DISEASE RELATIVE TO LOW SET2,3 DISEASE.

YUCCA FLAT IS A SEDIMENTARY BASIN WHICH HAS HOSTED MORE THAN 650 UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR TESTS (UGTS). THE SURVEY SOURCE WAS A NOVEL 13,000 KG MODIFIED INDUSTRIAL PILE DRIVER. THIS WEIGHT DROP SOURCE PROVED TO BE BROADBAND AND REPEATABLE, RICHER IN LOW FREQUENCIES (1-3 HZ) THAN TRADITIONAL VIBRATOR SOURCES AND CAPABLE OF PRODUCING PEAK PARTICLE VELOCITIES SIMILAR TO THOSE PRODUCED BY A 50 KG EXPLOSIVE CHARGE. IN THIS STUDY, WE PERFORMED A JOINT INVERSION OF P-WAVE REFRACTION TRAVEL TIMES AND RAYLEIGH-WAVE PHASE-VELOCITY DISPERSION CURVES FOR THE P- AND S-WAVE VELOCITY STRUCTURE OF YUCCA FLAT. PHASE-VELOCITY SURFACE-WAVE DISPERSION MEASUREMENTS WERE OBTAINED VIA THE REFRACTION MICROTREMOR METHOD ON 1 KM ARRAYS, WITH 80\% OVERLAP. OUR P-WAVE VELOCITY MODELS VERIFY AND EXPAND THE CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF YUCCA FLAT'S SUBSURFACE GEOMETRY AND BULK PROPERTIES SUCH AS DEPTH TO PALEOZOIC BASEMENT AND SHALLOW ALLUVIUM VELOCITY. AREAS OF DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THIS STUDY AND THE CURRENT GEOLOGIC MODEL OF YUCCA FLAT (DERIVED FROM BOREHOLE STUDIES) GENERALLY CORRELATE WITH AREAS OF WIDELY SPACED BOREHOLE CONTROL POINTS. THIS PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO UPDATE THE EXISTING MODEL, WHICH IS USED FOR MODELING GROUNDWATER FLOW AND RADIONUCLIDE TRANSPORT. SCATTERING CAUSED BY UGT-RELATED HIGH-CONTRAST VELOCITY ANOMALIES SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED THE NUMBER AND FREQUENCY BANDWIDTH OF USABLE DISPERSION PICKS. THE S-WAVE VELOCITY MODELS PRESENTED IN THIS STUDY AGREE WITH EXISTING BASIN-WIDE STUDIES OF YUCCA FLAT, BUT ARE COMPROMISED BY DIMINISHED SURFACE-WAVE COHERENCE AS A PRODUCT OF THIS SCATTERING. AS NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION MONITORING MOVES FROM TELESEISMIC TO REGIONAL OR EVEN LOCAL DISTANCES, SUCH HIGH-FREQUENCY (>5 HZ) SCATTERING COULD PROVE CHALLENGING WHEN ATTEMPTING TO DISCRIMINATE EVENTS IN AREAS OF PREVIOUS TESTING.","400 EVELYN AVE, SUITE 201, ALBANY, CA 94706-1375 USA","UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA FAIRBANKS; CLAREMONT COLLEGES; POMONA COLLEGE; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES; UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AUSTIN; PENNSYLVANIA STATE SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PASSHE); KUTZTOWN UNIVERSITY - PENNSYLVANIA",NA,"LDT02013@MYMAIL.POMONA.EDU REABBOTT@SANDIA.GOV LPRESTO@SANDIA.GOV DTANG@UTEXAS.EDU T.S.FINLAY@GMAIL.COM KRISTIN.E.PHILLIPS-ALONGE.CIV@MAIL.MIL","2022-11-29","JA4PT","10.1785/0120180322",NA,"1943-3573","INCORPORATED RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS FOR SEISMOLOGY INTERNSHIP PROGRAM; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION [DE-NA0003525]","THE SOURCE PHYSICS EXPERIMENTS (SPE) WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF MANY PEOPLE FROM SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS.

THE USE OF LOW- INSTEAD OF HIGH-ENRICHED URANIUM IN SMALL NUCLEAR REACTORS STEMS FROM RECENT NATIONAL POLICIES ASSOCIATED WITH NONPROLIFERATION. NEW DESIGNS ARE BEING DEVELOPED FOR A RANGE OF APPLICATIONS AND NUCLEAR SPACE SYSTEMS IN PARTICULAR. USING SYSTEM GEOMETRIES SUCH AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER, THE NEXT STEP IS TO ADVANCE THE TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL OF MODERATOR MATERIAL SUCH AS DELTA-YTTRIUM HYDRIDE (YHX,X (=) (1.6-2.0)) SO THAT IT CAN BE QUALIFIED FOR USE IN A MICROREACTOR SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH CHARACTERIZATION OF UNIRRADIATED MATERIAL HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED PREVIOUSLY, TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS MATERIAL, BEHAVIOR IN RELEVANT IRRADIATION ENVIRONMENTS MUST OCCUR. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE FABRICATION OF YTTRIUM HYDRIDE SAMPLES THROUGH INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUES AND HOW THESE SAMPLES WERE TESTED IN TWO RELEVANT NEUTRON ENVIRONMENTS. THESE TWO EXPERIMENTS INCLUDE (1) A CRITICAL EXPERIMENT PERFORMED AT THE NATIONAL CRITICALITY EXPERIMENTS RESEARCH CENTER (NCERC) TO EVALUATE REACTIVITY CHANGES IN A NEUTRON-CRITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND (2) IRRADIATION IN THE ADVANCED TEST REACTOR (ATR) TO ASSESS STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY/MATERIAL FORM, THERMOPHYSICAL DATA, HYDROGEN PERMEABILITY, AND OTHER FEATURES POST IRRADIATION.

ALL THREE COUNTRIES ARE NON-WEAPON-STATE PARTIES TO THE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY (NPT). THEIR INTEREST IN NAVAL REACTORS BRINGS WITH IT TWO CHALLENGES TO THE NPT: (1) THE SAFEGUARDS ``LOOPHOLE'' UNDER WHICH A COUNTRY CAN WITHDRAW NUCLEAR MATERIALS FROM IAEA SAFEGUARDS INDEFINITELY FOR ALLOWED ``NON-PEACEFUL ACTIVITIES''; AND (2) A JUSTIFICATION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF NATIONAL URANIUM-ENRICHMENT FACILITIES BECAUSE THE INTERNATIONAL SUPPLIERS OF ENRICHMENT SERVICES HAVE PEACEFUL-USE REQUIREMENTS. IN FACT, BRAZIL'S ACQUISITION OF ENRICHMENT WAS DRIVEN BY ITS NAVY. IT IS ARGUED, HOWEVER, THAT NUCLEAR-POWERED ATTACK SUBMARINES HAVE ADVANTAGES OVER MODERN CONVENTIONAL ATTACK SUBMARINES PRIMARILY IN THEIR ABILITY TO TRANSIT GREAT DISTANCES AT HIGH SPEED WHEREAS ONLY A FEW COUNTRIES HAVE FOREIGN MILITARY COMMITMENTS REQUIRING SUCH CAPABILITIES. FOR DEFENSE OF NEARBY WATERS AGAINST FOREIGN NAVIES, ATTACK SUBMARINES ARE MERELY ONE COMPONENT OF A COMPLEX SYSTEM OF ANTI-SUBMARINE AIRCRAFT AND SURFACE VESSELS AND UNDERWATER SENSOR NETWORKS.

NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION AND SAFEGUARDS IS A FIELD OF PARTICULAR RELEVANCE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SIPMS AS THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE CAPABLE OF SIMULTANEOUSLY DETECTING GAMMA RAYS AND NEUTRONS WHEN COUPLED WITH ORGANIC SCINTILLATORS AND UTILIZING PULSE-SHAPE DISCRIMINATION (PSD). AS SUCH, AN ASSESSMENT OF THE STATE OF THE ART IN SIPM TECHNOLOGY AND STUDY OF THE IMPACT CERTAIN SIPM CHARACTERISTICS HAVE ON PERFORMANCE IN DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS IS REQUIRED. THIS PAPER CHARACTERIZES THE PERFORMANCE OF 20 DIFFERENT SIPMS FROM FIVE MANUFACTURERS WITH PIXEL SIZES RANGING FROM 3 TO 6 MM AND MICROCELL SIZE RANGING FROM 15 TO 75 MU M. EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON THE ABILITY TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NEUTRONS AND GAMMA RAYS WHEN COUPLED TO ORGANIC SCINTILLATOR STILBENE AS A FUNCTION OF OVERVOLTAGE, AS WELL AS THE NOISE. COMPARISON WITH A FAST PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBE (PMT) SHOWS THAT CURRENT GENERATION SIPMS PERFORM COMPETITIVELY WITH PMTS IN PSD, AND IT IS FOUND THAT SIPMS WITH LARGER MICROCELLS TEND TO HAVE MORE EFFECTIVE NEUTRON-GAMMA RAY DISCRIMINATION CAPABILITY.","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE); PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY; PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY - UNIVERSITY PARK; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); IDAHO NATIONAL LABORATORY",NA,"MFW5173@PSU.EDU DAVID.CHICHESTER@INL.GOV MFLASKA@PSU.EDU","2022-11-29","GT9YY","10.1109/TNS.2018.2829346",NA,"1558-1578","U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS FROM THE HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT SUBPROGRAM","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS FROM THE HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT SUBPROGRAM.","0018-9499","IEEE TRANS.

OF THE CURRENTLY FEASIBLE NEUTRON IMAGING CONCEPTS, THE NEUTRON SCATTER CAMERA IS THE ONE THAT CAN BE MADE MOST COMPACT AND VERSATILE. BENEFICIALLY, THIS DESIGN ALSO INHERENTLY MEASURES THE ENERGY OF INCIDENT NEUTRONS ON AN EVENT-BY-EVENT BASIS. SINGLE VOLUME AND QUASI-SINGLE VOLUME NEUTRON SCATTERS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO FULLY MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL OF NEUTRON SCATTER CAMERAS AND ENABLE TRULY MAN-PORTABLE NEUTRON IMAGERS. SUCH IMAGERS WILL LIKELY HAVE A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF READOUT CHANNELS TO MAXIMIZE THE EFFICIENCY, SO SIGNAL MULTIPLEXING TO REDUCE READOUT CHANNELS WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE COSTS AND SIZE AND FACILITATE WIDESPREAD DEPLOYMENT. IN THIS WORK A MULTIPLEXING METHOD BASED ON ADDING WELL-DEFINED SINUSOIDS TO DETECTOR SIGNAL IS APPLIED TO A QUASI-SINGLE VOLUME NEUTRON SCATTER CAMERA COMPRISED OF 6-MM X 6-MM X 60-MM EJ-299-34 PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS COUPLED TO ARRAYS OF SENSL 60035 C-SERIES SILICON PHOTOMULTIPLIERS TO CREATE A MULTIPLEXED NEUTRON IMAGER (MINI). SUCH STRAIGHTFORWARD MULTIPLEXING ENABLES THE USE OF MORE DETECTOR ELEMENTS FOR A GIVEN NUMBER OF AVAILABLE SIGNAL READOUTS. THE NECESSARY CALIBRATIONS AND SYSTEM CHARACTERIZATIONS ARE CARRIED OUT TO ASSESS THE MULTIPLEXING METHOD'S PERFORMANCE AND TO UNDERSTAND THE BEHAVIOR OF THE PROTOTYPE MINI. ITS ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMAGE A NEUTRON SOURCE IS DEMONSTRATED WITH A CF-252 SPONTANEOUS FISSION SOURCE PLACED IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS AROUND THE MINI. FINALLY, NEUTRON SPECTROSCOPY IS ALSO PERFORMED, AND THE FEASIBILITY AND BENEFITS OF MULTIPLEXING A QUASI-SINGLE VOLUME NEUTRON SCATTER CAMERA ARE DEMONSTRATED.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE); PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY; PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY - UNIVERSITY PARK","165294","MFW5173@PSU.EDU","2022-11-29","RS0SH","10.1016/j.nima.2021.165294","APR 2021","1872-9576",NA,NA,"0168-9002","NUCL.

IT IS ALSO A VOLATILE BYPRODUCT OF THE NUCLEAR FISSION OF URANIUM. A NOVEL MATERIAL ARCHITECTURE CONSISTING OF SILICATE NANOCAGES IN CONTACT WITH A METAL SURFACE AND AN APPROACH FOR TRAPPING SINGLE XE ATOMS IN THESE CAGES IS PRESENTED. THE TRAPPING IS DONE AT LOW XE PRESSURES AND TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 400 AND 600 K, AND THE PROCESS IS MONITORED IN SITU USING SYNCHROTRON-BASED AMBIENT PRESSURE X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY. RELEASE OF THE XE FROM THE CAGES OCCURS ONLY WHEN HEATING TO TEMPERATURES ABOVE 750 K. A MODEL THAT EXPLAINS THE EXPERIMENTAL TRAPPING KINETICS IS PROPOSED AND TESTED USING MONTE CARLO METHODS. DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY CALCULATIONS SHOW ACTIVATION ENERGIES FOR XE EXITING THE CAGES CONSISTENT WITH EXPERIMENTS. THIS WORK CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS IN VARIOUS FIELDS, INCLUDING XE PRODUCTION, NUCLEAR POWER, NUCLEAR WASTE REMEDIATION, AND NONPROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE RESULTS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO APPLY TO ARGON, KRYPTON, AND RADON, OPENING AN EVEN MORE COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS.","POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY","STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK (SUNY) SYSTEM; SUNY COMMUNITY COLLEGE; STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK (SUNY) STONY BROOK; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY; UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE; STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK (SUNY) SYSTEM; SUNY COMMUNITY COLLEGE; STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK (SUNY) STONY BROOK; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY; CONSEJO NACIONAL DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS Y TECNICAS (CONICET); UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DE SAN LUIS; UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA; CONSEJO NACIONAL DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS Y TECNICAS (CONICET); UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DE SAN LUIS","2103661","MDORNELES@BNL.GOV JBOSCOBOINIK@BNL.GOV","2022-11-29","UZ8WS","10.1002/smll.202103661","AUG 2021","1613-6829","U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, OFFICE OF BASIC ENERGY SCIENCES [DE-SC0012704]; ACS PRF GRANT [61059-ND5]; CATALYSIS CENTER FOR ENERGY INNOVATION, AN ENERGY FRONTIER RESEARCH CENTER - U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, OFFICE OF SCIENCE, OFFICE OF BASIC ENERGY SCIENCES [DE-SC0001004]","THE RESEARCH WAS PERFORMED AT THE CENTER FOR FUNCTIONAL NANOMATERIALS AND THE 23-ID-2 (IOS) BEAMLINE OF THE NATIONAL SYNCHROTRON LIGHT SOURCE II, BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY, SUPPORTED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, OFFICE OF BASIC ENERGY SCIENCES, UNDER CONTRACT NO.
