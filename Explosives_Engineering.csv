ONE CHALLENGE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO SOCIETY IS DETECTING AND LOCALIZING AIRBORNE VOLATILE CHEMICALS. MANY FLYING ANIMALS DEPEND THEIR ABILITY TO DETECT AND LOCATE THE SOURCE OF AERIAL CHEMICAL PLUMES FOR FINDING MATES AND FOOD SOURCES. A ROBOT WITH COMPARABLE CAPABILITY COULD REDUCE HUMAN HAZARD AND DRASTICALLY IMPROVE PERFORMANCE ON TASKS SUCH AS LOCATING DISASTER SURVIVORS, HAZARDOUS GAS LEAKS, INCIPIENT FIRES, OR EXPLOSIVES. THREE ADVANCES ARE NEEDED BEFORE THEY CAN RIVAL THEIR BIOLOGICAL COUNTERPARTS: (1) A CHEMICAL SENSOR WITH A MUCH FASTER RESPONSE TIME THAT NEVERTHELESS SATISFIES THE SIZE, WEIGHT, AND POWER CONSTRAINTS OF FLIGHT, (2) A DESIGN, SENSOR SUITE, AND CONTROL SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS IT TO MOVE TOWARD THE SOURCE OF A PLUME FULLY AUTONOMOUSLY WHILE NAVIGATING OBSTACLES, AND (3) THE ABILITY TO DETECT THE PLUME WITH HIGH SPECIFICITY AND SENSITIVITY AMONG THE ASSORTMENT OF CHEMICALS THAT INVARIABLY EXIST IN THE AIR. HERE WE ADDRESS THE FIRST TWO, INTRODUCING A HUMAN-SAFE PALM-SIZED AIR VEHICLE EQUIPPED WITH THE ODOR-SENSING ANTENNA OF AN INSECT, THE FIRST ODOR-SENSING BIOHYBRID ROBOT SYSTEM TO FLY. USING THIS SENSOR ALONG WITH A SUITE OF ADDITIONAL NAVIGATIONAL SENSORS, AS WELL AS PASSIVE WIND FINS, OUR ROBOT ORIENTS UPWIND AND NAVIGATES AUTONOMOUSLY TOWARD THE SOURCE OF AIRBORNE PLUMES. OUR ROBOT IS THE FIRST FLYING BIOHYBRID SYSTEM TO SUCCESSFULLY PERFORM ODOR LOCALIZATION IN A CONFINED SPACE, AND IT IS ABLE TO DO SO WHILE DETECTING AND AVOIDING OBSTACLES IN ITS FLIGHT PATH. WE SHOW THAT INSECT ANTENNAE RESPOND MORE QUICKLY THAN METAL OXIDE GAS SENSORS, ENABLING ODOR LOCALIZATION AT AN IMPROVED SPEED OVER PREVIOUS FLYING ROBOTS. BY USING THE INSECT ANTENNAE, WE ANTICIPATE A FEASIBLE PATH TOWARD IMPROVED CHEMICAL SPECIFICITY AND SENSITIVITY BY LEVERAGING RECENT ADVANCES IN GENE EDITING.","TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON; UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SEATTLE; UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON; UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SEATTLE; UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF MARYLAND; UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND COLLEGE PARK; UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON; UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SEATTLE; UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON; UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SEATTLE","026002","MELANIEA@UW.EDU JGS6156@UW.EDU TIMMER@ISR.UMD.EDU MINSTER@UW.EDU DANIELT@UW.EDU","2022-12-01","QG4NN","10.1088/1748-3190/abbd81",NA,"1748-3190",NA,NA,"NATIONAL DEFENSE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP; WASHINGTON RESEARCH FOUNDATION; JOAN AND RICHARD KOMEN ENDOWED CHAIR; AIR FORCE OFFICE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (AFOSR) [FA9550-14-1-0398]","THIS WORK HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL DEFENSE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP, THE WASHINGTON RESEARCH FOUNDATION, THE JOAN AND RICHARD KOMEN ENDOWED CHAIR, AND THE AIR FORCE OFFICE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (AFOSR), GRANT NOS.

HOWEVER, NUMERICAL MODELLING OF GEOELECTRICAL RESPONSES IN REALISTIC FRACTURED MEDIA HAS BEEN CHALLENGING DUE TO THE EXPLOSIVE COMPUTATIONAL COST IMPOSED BY THE EXPLICIT DISCRETIZATIONS OF FRACTURES AT MULTIPLE LENGTH SCALES, WHICH OFTEN BRINGS ABOUT A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND GEOLOGICAL REALISM. HERE, WE USE THE HIERARCHICAL FINITE ELEMENT METHOD (WEISS, 2017) TO MODEL THE ELECTROSTATIC RESPONSE OF REALISTICALLY COMPLEX 3-D CONDUCTIVE FRACTURE NETWORKS WITH MINIMAL COMPUTATIONAL COST. THIS FINITE ELEMENT APPROACH UTILIZES A NOVEL PARAMETRIZATION OF ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY IN 3-D CONDUCTING MEDIA THAT ALLOWS ASSIGNMENT OF ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES AT EACH HIERARCHICAL COMPONENT OF A FINITE VOLUMETRIC ELEMENT (1-D EDGES, 2-D FACETS AND 3-D TETRAHEDRA) WITHIN AN UNSTRUCTURED TETRAHEDRA MESH. BY EMPLOYING THIS HIERARCHICAL MATERIAL MODEL CONCEPT IN THE FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS, 3-D FRACTURES CAN BE EXPLICITLY REPRESENTED BY CONNECTED FACET ELEMENTS OR LINEAR GEOLOGICAL FEATURES AS WELL AS INFRASTRUCTURES SUCH AS BOREHOLE CASINGS, RAILS, PIPES CAN BE EXPLICITLY REPRESENTED IN FORM OF CONNECTED EDGES IN FINITE ELEMENT MESH, AND THEREFORE THE NEED OF MESH REFINEMENT DUE TO VOLUMETRICALLY INSIGNIFICANT STRUCTURES CAN BE DRASTICALLY REDUCED. IN THIS STUDY, STOCHASTICALLY GENERATED, COMPLEX 3-D FRACTURE NETWORK MODELS ARE CONSIDERED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HETEROGENEITY OF FRACTURE NETWORK AND THE RESULTING DIRECT CURRENT (DC) RESISTIVITY RESPONSES. WE MAINLY FOCUS ON THE EFFECTS OF FRACTURE LENGTH AND APERTURE DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE AZIMUTHAL VARIATIONS IN DC RESISTIVITY. OUR NUMERICAL RESULTS INDICATE THAT CONDUCTIVE FRACTURE NETWORKS WITH HIGH NETWORK CONNECTIVITY RESULT IN ANOMALOUSLY LOW APPARENT RESISTIVITY VALUES WITH STRONG AZIMUTHAL DEPENDENCE IN COMPARISON WITH NETWORKS WITH LOW NETWORK CONNECTIVITY. MOREOVER, OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT WHILE THE FRACTURE SIZE-APERTURE CORRELATION HAS A STRONG INFLUENCE ON DC RESISTIVITY RESPONSES WHEN THE FRACTURE NETWORK IS WELL CONNECTED, THE INFLUENCE OF APERTURE IS MARGINAL FOR FRACTURE NETWORKS WITH POOR NETWORK CONNECTIVITY.","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES; UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO",NA,"GDBESKA@SANDIA.GOV","2022-12-01","GO0SF","10.1093/gji/ggy234",NA,"1365-246X",NA,NA,"U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION [DE-NA-0003525]; SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES LDRD PROGRAM","SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES IS A MULTIMISSION LABORATORY MANAGED AND OPERATED BY NATIONAL TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS OF SANDIA, LLC., A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL, INC., FOR THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION UNDER CONTRACT DE-NA-0003525.

WITH EVER INCREASING KNOWLEDGE, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO INTERVENE THERAPEUTICALLY TO REGULATE THESE NETWORKS, WHICH WILL LEAD TO NEW THERAPIES TO INDUCE REGENERATION. THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES HOW TO DO THIS, RATHER THEN WHEN TO TRY. OUR THESIS IS THAT THE TIME IS NOW, AND THAT THIS FEAT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY COMBINING THE INSIGHTS PROVIDED BY DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGISTS WITH THE TECHNOLOGIES BEING DEVELOPED BY BIOMATERIAL ENGINEERS, TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF ENGINEERING REGENERATION. WE THUS ENVISION REGENERATIVE ENGINEERING AS THE NEXT STEP TOWARD ACHIEVING THE GOAL OF HUMAN REGENERATION. AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES ABOUT REGENERATION FROM STUDIES OF SALAMANDERS THAT REGENERATE EXCEPTIONALLY WELL, IS THAT BOTH PATTERN-FOLLOWING AND PATTERN-FORMING CELLS ARE REQUIRED. MUCH PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TOWARD UNDERSTANDING THE FORMER CELLS, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE CELLS THAT CONTROL POSITIONAL INFORMATION AND PATTERN FORMATION. WITHIN THE NEAR FUTURE, IT WILL BECOME POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION NEEDED FOR REGENERATION EXOGENOUSLY IN THE FORM OF AN ENGINEERED EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX THAT IS A BIOMIMETIC OF THE ENDOGENOUS INFORMATION. SINCE GROWTH FACTORS (MORPHOGENS) CAN CONTROL PATTERN FORMATION, AN ENGINEERED GRID COULD BE BASED ON SPATIALLY ORGANIZED PATTERNS OF SULFATION OF GLYCOSAMINOGLYCANS THAT CONTROL THE BEHAVIOR OF CELLS BY MODULATING MORPHOGEN ACTIVITY. PROGRESS IN ENGINEERING THE POSITIONAL INFORMATION GRID FOR REGENERATION WILL NECESSITATE LEARNING THE SULFATION CODES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCCESSFUL REGENERATION IN ANIMALS SUCH AS SALAMANDERS.","PO BOX 1397, BILBAO, BIZKAIA E-48080, SPAIN","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE",NA,"DMGARDIN@UCI.EDU","2022-12-01","HC3GZ","10.1387/ijdb.170269dg",NA,"1696-3547",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0214-6282","INT.

PBX 9701 IS A NEWLY DEVELOPED REDUCEDSENSITIVITY EXPLOSIVE WITH INCREASED PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE TRIAMINOTRINITROBENZENE OR TATB-BASED PBX 9502 WHILE STILL RETAINING LOW SENSITIVITY TO MECHANICAL INSULT. THE FIRST DETONATION PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS FOR THIS FORMULATION ARE PRESENTED, INCLUDING FRON CURVATURE RATE STICKS AND CYLINDER EXPANSION TEST DATA. PRIOR SHOCK INITIATION DATA IS ALSO REVIEWED. THESE DATA ARE USED TO DEVELOP PROGRAMMED BURN (PB) AND REACTIVE BURN (RB) CALIBRATIONS FOR EXISTING, COMMONLY USED, PERFORMANCE MODELS WHICH ALLOW ENGINEERING CALCULATIONS WITH PBX 9701. THE CALIBRATION PROCESS INVOLVES SEVERAL ENHANCEMENTS RELATIVE CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES, INCLUDING THE USE OF AN ANALYTICAL SCALING CORRELATION TO SPEED THE EQUATION STATE (EOS) CALIBRATION PROCESS. IT USES A PB HYDROCODE-BASED APPROACH AND DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW METHODOLOGY TO IMPROVE THE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE PB AND RB MODEL CALIBRATIONS AND ASSOCIATED CALCULATIONS. THIS LINK IS ACHIEVED BY POPULATING THE RB PRODUCTS EOS IN DIRECT REFERENCE TO THE PB RELEASE ISENTROPE AND CHAPMAN-JOUGUET STATE AND IN CALIBRATING THE TIMING COMPONENTS OF EACH MODEL USING AN EQUIVALENT PROCEDURE, ALL IN ORDER TO FACILITATE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO MODELING APPROACHES.

WE SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED GAN METHOD ALSO PERMITS THE GENERATION OF NEW MORPHOLOGIES, WHERE THE POROSITY DISTRIBUTION CAN BE CONTROLLED AND SPATIALLY MANIPULATED.

THEREFORE, THERE IS AN ONGOING DEMAND FOR METHODS OF ANALYSIS WITH LIMITS OF DETECTION AT TRACE LEVELS FOR THESE HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS. SINCE HUMAN HAIR IS ONE OF THE MAIN PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES OF OUR BODIES, THE INTERACTION OF HAIR SURFACES WITH HE CAN BE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE IN FORENSIC AND SECURITY APPLICATIONS. NONINVASIVE IN SITU APPROACHES SUCH AS SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS ARE PREFERRED FOR ELUCIDATING THESE INTERACTIONS. AMONG THE SPECTROSCOPY-BASED METHODOLOGIES, THOSE BASED ON RAMAN SCATTERING ARE OFTEN FAVORED BECAUSE THE SHARPNESS OF THE VIBRATIONAL SIGNALS FACILITATES THE PRECISE LOCATION OF THE PEAK MAXIMA AND ENABLES MORE PRECISE DETERMINATION OF THE BAND SHIFTS DUE TO INTERMOLECULAR INTERACTIONS. THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY IS BASED ON THE DETECTION OF THE HES 2,4,6-TRINITROTOLUENE (TNT), 1,3,5-TRINITROPERHYDRO-1,3,5-TRIAZINE (RDX), AND PENTAERYTHRITOL TETRANITRATE (PETN) ON HUMAN HAIR STRANDS BY RS. RAMAN SPECTRAL LIBRARIES OBTAINED WITH A 660-NM LASER EXCITATION LINE WERE GENERATED FOR BLACK, BLEACHED, AND NATURAL GRAY HAIR USING DIRECT DEPOSITION OF PETN, TNT, AND RDX. RESULTS OBTAINED WERE CONFIRMED USING PORTABLE SYSTEMS OPERATING AT 785 AND 1064 NM. SPECTRAL DATA WERE PREPROCESSED TO CORRECT A HIGH FLUORESCENCE BACKGROUND EXHIBITED BY THE SAMPLES DUE TO THE INDOLE GROUPS AND MELANIN PRESENT IN HAIR. DESPITE THE HIGH FLUORESCENCE LEVELS THAT CHARACTERIZED ALL THE SAMPLES, THE VIBRATIONAL SIGNATURES THAT IDENTIFY THE PRESENCE OF THE HES STUDIED COULD BE DETECTED ONCE THE OPTIMUM ACQUISITION PARAMETERS WERE ESTABLISHED. AMONG THE THREE HAIR TYPES STUDIED, GRAY HAIR WAS THE BEST SUBSTRATE TO OBSERVE THE VIBRATIONS OF HE CRYSTALS ON HAIR. A METHOD LIMIT OF DETECTION OF 2 +/- 1 NG WAS ESTIMATED FROM IMAGE ANALYSIS OF THE HE CRYSTALS OBSERVED AND CONFIRMED AS SIMILAR TO 3 +/- 1 NG USING SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS.

AN MIR QUANTUM CASCADE LASER (QCL) WAS OPTICALLY COUPLED TO A GRAZING ANGLE PROBE (QCL-GAP) MOUNT TO OPERATE IN DIFFUSE REFLECTANCE MODE AT AN INCIDENCE ANGLE OF 82 DEG FROM THE SURFACE NORMAL. THE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS ENABLED REFLECTION-ABSORPTION INFRARED REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY OF THE LASER LIGHT BY THE SURFACE DEPOSITS OF HES AND ALLOWED OBTAINING SPECTRA WITH HIGH SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS IN A VERY SHORT TIME. THIS OPTICAL ARRANGEMENT PERMITTED COLLECTING DATA FOR IDENTIFYING THE VIBRATIONAL SIGNATURES OF THE HES TO BE DETECTABLE EVEN AT LOW SURFACE CONCENTRATIONS. THE HES USED INCLUDED PENTAERYTHRITOL TETRANITRATE, 1,3,5-TRINITROPERHYDRO-1,3,5-TRIAZINE, AND 2,4,6-TRINITROPHENYLMETHYLNITRAMINE. USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS, 100\% OF THE HE SAMPLES DEPOSITED ON THE REFLECTIVE AND NONREFLECTIVE SUBSTRATE WERE CORRECTLY CLASSIFIED, AVOIDING FALSEPOSITIVE RESPONSES IN THE ANALYSES. THE COMBINATION OF QCL-GAP SPECTROSCOPY WITH MVA PRESENTED WILL ALSO ALLOW OBTAINING HIGHLY CONFIDENT DETECTIONS/IDENTIFICATION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND OTHER CHEMICAL/BIOLOGICAL AGENTS RESIDING ON BOTH REFLECTIVE AND NONREFLECTIVE SURFACES. THE METHODOLOGY CAN EASILY BE EXTENDED TO OTHER TYPES OF APPLICATIONS.

E., 1963","AQUACULTURE IS NOTHING NEW. IT HAS A LONG, FASCINATING HISTORY THAT STRETCHES FROM ANTIQUITY AT LEAST 8,000 YEARS AGO. WHAT IS NEW IS THE EVOLUTION OF AQUACULTURE IN MODERN TIMES INTO HIGHLY INTENSIVE MONOCULTURES WHICH AROSE IN THE 1970-1980'S. MODERN AQUACULTURE PRODUCTION HAS GROWN WORLDWIDE BUT REMAINS CONCENTRATED IN ASIA DUE TO THE: (1) INCREASED DEMANDS FOR AQUATIC FOODS AS EXPLOSIVE POPULATION GROWTH OCCURRED IN COASTAL CITIES WITH INCREASING AFFLUENCE, (2) EXPANSION OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING BREAKTHROUGHS, (3) HIGH EXPORT VALUES OF AQUATIC FOODS, AND (4) SHARP DECLINE OF COSTS OF GLOBAL TO LOCAL TRANSPORT/SHIPPING. THE PIONEERING ANTHROPOLOGIST CLAUDE LEVI-STRAUSS BROUGHT THE IDEA OF ``STRUCTURALISM'' TO ANTHROPOLOGY: THE CONCEPT THAT SOCIETIES THROUGHOUT HISTORY FOLLOWED UNIVERSAL PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR. A QUALITATIVE DOCUMENT ANALYSIS OF THE KEY ANTHROPOLOGICAL LITERATURE TO ASSESS AQUACULTURE DEVELOPMENTS FROM ANTIQUITY TO THE BEGINNING OF THE MODERN ERA WAS CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE IF THERE WAS ADEQUATE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A THEORY OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ``STRUCTURALISM'' FOR AQUACULTURE IN HUMAN HISTORY. SEVEN CASE STUDIES OF THE CULTURAL/ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY OF AQUACULTURE WERE REVIEWED IN DIVERSE PARTS OF THE WORLD (CHINA, AUSTRALIA, EGYPT, EUROPE, SOUTH AMERICA, CANADA/USA, HAWAI'I). ANALYSIS SUPPORTS THE STRUCTURAL THEORY THAT WHENEVER THE DEMANDS OF AQUATIC/SEAFOOD-EATING PEOPLES EXCEEDED THE ABILITIES OF THEIR INDIGENOUS FISHERY ECOSYSTEMS TO PROVIDE FOR THEM, THEY DEVELOPED AQUACULTURE. MODERN AQUACULTURE CONCEPTS AND NEW COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE IN ``RESTORATION AQUACULTURE'' HAVE BEGINNINGS IN INDIGENOUS ANTHROPOLOGY AND ARCHEOLOGY IN AQUACULTURE AND POINT THE WAY FOR INDIGENOUS NATIONS TO ENGAGE AS LEADERS OF THE UNITED NATIONS FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) ECOSYSTEM APPROACH TO AQUACULTURE WORLDWIDE.

SPECTROSCOPIC PROCESS IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF MONITORING TRANSMISSION AND REFLECTION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES FROM MATERIAL UNDER TEST, WHEN ITS NATURAL RESONANCE PHENOMENA MATCHES WITH THIS SPECTRA, AND RELIES ON AVAILABILITY OF TUNABLE HIGH-POWER FREQUENCY SOURCES AND SENSITIVE DETECTORS. THZ SOURCES HAVE BEEN OF GREAT INTEREST FOR QUITE SOME TIME DUE TO THEIR SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS IN SENSING, IMAGING, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS, WITH SIGNIFICANT SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST ARE DATA COMMUNICATION OF OVER 100GB/S USING THZ FREQUENCY FOR DISTRIBUTION OF SUPER-RESOLUTION IMAGES OVER DISTANCES UP TO A KM. IN ADDITION, PATHOGENS AND CONCEALED DRUGS OR EXPLOSIVES COULD BE DETECTED USING SPECTROSCOPY OF SEALED PACKAGES WITH NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST. VARIOUS TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN PURSUED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THZ FREQUENCY SOURCES, SUCH AS ELECTRONICS AND PHOTONICS APPROACHES. AMONG THEM ARE RESONANT TUNNELING DIODE, TRAVELING WAVE TUBE, INJECTION-SEEDED PARAMETRIC OSCILLATOR, AND QUANTUM CASCADE LASERS (QCL), WHICH ARE THE MOST ATTRACTIVE. QCLS ARE VERSATILE LIGHT SOURCES WITH TAILORABLE EMITTING WAVELENGTHS COVERING THE MID-INFRARED LONG-INFRARED (I.E., THZ DOMAIN) OF ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM. IN PRINCIPLE, THE ELECTRONIC APPROACHES SUFFER FROM LOWER EFFICIENCY THAN PHOTONICS TECHNIQUES; PARTICULARLY, WHEN A QCL ACTIVE REGION IS DE-SIGNED WITH STRONG COUPLING BETWEEN THE LOWER LASING LEVELS AND INJECTOR LEVELS, WHICH RESULTS IN A LARGE NONLINEAR SUSCEPTIBILITY.(2), THZ EMISSION CAN BE GENERATED WITHIN THE CAVITY OF QCL WITH A GREATER EFFICIENCY. PROFESSOR MANIJEH RAZEGHI, THE 2018 FRANKLIN MEDALIST IN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND FOUNDING DIRECTOR, HAS DEMONSTRATED BY MINIMIZING DISPERSION, FREQUENCY COMBS CAN BE DIRECTLY EMITTED FROM QCL VIA FOUR-WAVE MIXING WITH OUTPUT POWER OF ABOUT 1W AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.

THIS ARTICLE DOES SO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF JOSEPH GAVIN, JR., WHO LED APOLLO'S LUNAR MODULE (LM) PROGRAM FROM ITS UNOFFICIAL ORIGINS AS A CONTROVERSIAL DREAM AT GRUMMAN IN 1960, TO ITS OFFICIAL INCEPTION BY NASA IN 1962, TO ITS SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION IN 1972. HE DIRECTED AS MANY AS 7500 EMPLOYEES IN DEVELOPING THE LM AND ULTIMATELY BUILDING TWELVE OPERATIONAL VEHICLES. ALL MET MISSION REQUIREMENTS, AND THOSE THAT ACTUALLY MADE A LUNAR LANDING WORKED EVERY TIME. DEVELOPING THE STATE-OF-THE-ART MACHINE REQUIRED UNPRECEDENTED INNOVATIONS AND MAXIMIZATION OF RELIABILITY AMID INHERENTLY UNKNOWN AND UNTESTABLE CONDITIONS. WHEN CONGRATULATED ON THE SUCCESS OF EACH LANDING, GAVIN TYPICALLY REPLIED THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SATISFIED UNTIL HIS SPACECRAFT AND ITS CREW GOT OFF THE MOON AND ARRIVED HOME SAFELY. THIS PROCESS REQUIRED THREE PROCEDURES IN UNISON (FIRING OF EXPLOSIVE BOLTS, SEVERING BY GUILLOTINE OF WIRES AND OTHER CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE DESCENT AND ASCENT STAGES, AND FIRING OF THE ASCENT ENGINE). EACH FUNCTION COULD BE TESTED ON EARTH INDIVIDUALLY, BUT NOT UNDER LUNAR CONDITIONS AT SYSTEMS LEVEL. GAVIN DREW LESSONS FROM HIS GRUMMAN CORPORATION TEAM AND ITS SUBCONTRACTORS' EXPERIENCE THAT THE AUTHOR DISTILLS INTO EIGHT PRINCIPLES: (1) ABOVE ALL, RETURN ASTRONAUTS SAFELY TO EARTH; ACCORDINGLY: (2) CREATE CONDITIONS FOR SUCCESS, (3) ATTAIN RELIABILITY, (4) PRIORITIZE INNOVATION OVER SCHEDULE OVER COST, (5) DON'T COMPLICATE THINGS UNNECESSARILY; (6) REMOVE HIERARCHICAL BARRIERS; (7) EMPOWER INDIVIDUALS, AND (8) SHARE INFORMATION. SERVING IN TOP MANAGEMENT SUBSEQUENTLY RETURNED GAVIN TO THE NAVAL AIRCRAFT DEVELOPMENT THAT REMAINED GRUMMAN'S SPECIALTY. HE APPLIED THE BEST PRACTICES LEARNED FROM LM DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY IMPROVING INITIAL CONSTRUCTION TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR TESTS (PER PRINCIPLE THREE). DRAWING ON EXTENSIVE INTERVIEWS WITH GAVIN AND THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF HIS PERSONAL MATERIALS, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HIS LESSONS AND EXPLAINS HOW HE ENVISIONED AND APPLIED THEM IN PRACTICE AS AN AEROSPACE PROJECT ENGINEER LEADING ONE OF HISTORY'S GREATEST ENGINEERING ACHIEVEMENTS.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",NA,NA,"ANDREW\_ERICKSON@FAS.HARVARD.EDU","2022-12-01","PD6XH","10.1016/j.actaastro.2020.06.030",NA,"1879-2030",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0094-5765","ACTA ASTRONAUT.","ACTA ASTRONAUTICA","ENGLISH","DEC","191",NA,NA,"514-536","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","ENGINEERING",1,"LESSONS FROM THE LUNAR MODULE PROGRAM: THE DIRECTOR'S CONCLUSIONS","ARTICLE","WOS000597824900047","1","3","177","ENGINEERING, AEROSPACE","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2020,"ERICKSON, AS (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), NAVAL WAR COLL, NEWPORT, RI 02840 USA","ISI","NAVAL WAR COLL;NAVAL WAR COLL","NAVAL WAR COLL","ERICKSON AS, 2020, ACTA ASTRONAUT","ERICKSON AS, 2020, ACTA ASTRONAUT","USA",1,0

WE PRESENT A NOVEL COCRYSTAL SOLVATE COMPOSED OF 2,4,6-TRINITROTOLUENE (TNT) AND ANILINE THAT EXHIBITS UNIQUE PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND EXPLOSIVE PROPERTIES. X-RAY DIFFRACTION STUDIES REVEAL THE CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE TO CONTAIN TNT AND ANILINE IN A 1:1 MOLECULAR RATIO. THE CRYSTALS THEMSELVES EXHIBIT A VIBRANT, RUBY RED COLOR THAT LIKELY RESULTS DUE TO A CHARGE-TRANSFER INTERACTION BETWEEN THE OVERLAPPING PI-ORBITALS OF THE AROMATIC RINGS. THE MOST NOTABLE EVIDENCE FOR A CHARGE-TRANSFER COMPLEX IS THE APPEARANCE OF A BROAD ABSORBANCE PEAK IN THE VISIBLE REGION WHICH IS NOT PRESENT IN THE SPECTRUM OF EITHER PURE COMPONENT. COMPARISONS OF THE COCRYSTAL SOLVATE TO THAT OF PURE TNT ARE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THERMODYNAMIC AND KINETIC PARAMETERS USING BOTH EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL TECHNIQUES.

THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE ABILITY TO CONTROL CRYSTAL ORIENTATION AND POROSITY IN PENTAERYTHRITOL TETRANITRATE FILMS BY VARYING THE INTERFACIAL ENERGY BETWEEN THE SUBSTRATE AND THE VAPOR-DEPOSITED EXPLOSIVE. VARIATION IN DENSITY, POROSITY, SURFACE ROUGHNESS, AND OPTICAL PROPERTIES IS ACHIEVED IN THE EXPLOSIVE FILM, WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR INITIATION SENSITIVITY AND DETONATION PERFORMANCE OF THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL. VARIOUS SURFACE SCIENCE TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING ANGLE-RESOLVED X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY AND MULTILIQUID CONTACT ANGLE ANALYSIS, ARE UTILIZED TO CHARACTERIZE INTERFACIAL CHARACTERISTICS BETWEEN THE SUBSTRATE AND EXPLOSIVE FILM. OPTICAL MICROSCOPY AND SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY OF PENTAERYTHRITOL TETRANITRATE SURFACES AND FRACTURE CROSS SECTIONS ILLUSTRATE THE DIFFERENCE IN MORPHOLOGY EVOLUTION AND THE MICROSTRUCTURE ACHIEVED THROUGH SURFACE ENERGY MODIFICATION.

CONSEQUENTLY, THE DEVELOPMENT OF REMOTE, NONCONTACT DETECTION SYSTEMS CONTINUES TO REPRESENT A PATH FORWARD. IN THIS VEIN, A REMOTE DETECTION SYSTEM FOR EXCITATION OF INFRARED EMISSIONS USING A CO2 LASER FOR GENERATING LASER-INDUCED THERMAL EMISSION (LITE) IS A POSSIBLE SOLUTION. HOWEVER, A LITE SYSTEM USING A CO2 LASER HAS CERTAIN LIMITATIONS, SUCH AS THE REQUIREMENT OF CAREFUL ALIGNMENT, INTERFERENCE BY THE CO2 SIGNAL DURING DETECTION, AND THE POWER DENSITY LOSS DUE TO THE INCREASE OF THE LASER IMAGE AT THE SAMPLE PLANE WITH THE DETECTION DISTANCE. A REMOTE CHOPPED-LASER INDUCTION SYSTEM FOR LITE DETECTION USING A CO2 LASER SOURCE COUPLED TO A FOCUSING TELESCOPE WAS BUILT TO SOLVE SOME OF THESE LIMITATIONS. SAMPLES OF FIXED SURFACE CONCENTRATION (500 MU G/CM(2)) OF 1,3,5-TRINITROPERHYDRO-1,3,5-TRIAZINE (RDX) WERE USED FOR THE REMOTE DETECTION EXPERIMENTS AT DISTANCES RANGING BETWEEN 4 AND 8 M. THIS SYSTEM WAS CAPABLE OF THERMALLY EXCITING AND CAPTURING THE THERMAL EMISSIONS (TES) AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN A CYCLIC MANNER BY A FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED (FTIR) SPECTROMETER COUPLED TO A GOLD-COATED REFLECTION OPTICS TELESCOPE (FTIR-GT). THIS WAS DONE USING A WHEEL BLOCKING THE CAPTURE OF TE BY THE FTIR-GT CHOPPER WHILE HEATING THE SAMPLE WITH THE CO2 LASER. AS THE WHEEL MOVED, IT BLOCKED THE CO2 LASER AND ALLOWED THE SPECTROSCOPIC SYSTEM TO CAPTURE THE TES OF RDX. DIFFERENT PERIODS (OR FREQUENCIES) OF WHEEL SPIN AND FTIR-GT INTEGRATION TIMES WERE EVALUATED TO FIND DEPENDENCE WITH OBSERVATION DISTANCE OF THE MAXIMUM INTENSITY DETECTION, MINIMUM SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO, CO2 LASER SPOT SIZE INCREASE, AND THE INDUCED TEMPERATURE INCREMENT (DELTA T).

A MAJOR UNANSWERED QUESTION IS WHETHER LOSS OF POL EPSILON PROOFREADING BY ITSELF IS SUFFICIENT TO DRIVE THIS MUTAGENESIS, OR WHETHER ADDITIONAL FACTORS ARE NECESSARY. TO ADDRESS THIS, WE USED A COMBINATION OF NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING AND IN VITRO BIOCHEMISTRY ON HUMAN CELL LINES ENGINEERED TO HAVE DEFECTS IN POL EPSILON PROOFREADING AND MISMATCH REPAIR. ABSENT MISMATCH REPAIR, MONOALLELIC POL EPSILON PROOFREADING DEFICIENCY CAUSED A RAPID INCREASE IN A UNIQUE MUTATION SIGNATURE, SIMILAR TO THAT OBSERVED IN TUMORS FROM PATIENTS WITH BIALLELIC MISMATCH REPAIR DEFICIENCY AND HETEROZYGOUS POL EPSILON MUTATIONS. RESTORING MISMATCH REPAIR WAS SUFFICIENT TO SUPPRESS THE EXPLOSIVE MUTATION ACCUMULATION. THESE RESULTS STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT CONCOMITANT SUPPRESSION OF MISMATCH REPAIR, A HALLMARK OF COLORECTAL AND OTHER AGGRESSIVE CANCERS, IS A CRITICAL FORCE FOR DRIVING THE EXPLOSIVE MUTAGENESIS SEEN IN TUMORS EXPRESSING EXONUCLEASE-DEFICIENT POL EPSILON.","SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND","TULANE UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO; UNIVERSITY TORONTO AFFILIATES; HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHILDREN (SICKKIDS); UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO; UNIVERSITY TORONTO AFFILIATES; HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHILDREN (SICKKIDS); UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO; TULANE UNIVERSITY; TULANE UNIVERSITY; TULANE UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO; UNIVERSITY TORONTO AFFILIATES; HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHILDREN (SICKKIDS); UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO; UNIVERSITY TORONTO AFFILIATES; HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHILDREN (SICKKIDS); UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO; TULANE UNIVERSITY; CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE (CNRS); CNRS - NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGY (INSB); UDICE-FRENCH RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES; SORBONNE UNIVERSITE; UNIVERSITE PARIS CITE; LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM; LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO","E32692","ZPURSELL@TULANE.EDU","2022-12-01","FX7DZ","10.7554/eLife.32692",NA,NA,NA,NA,"TULANE UNIVERSITY; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES [NIH R01ES028271, NIH R56ES026821, NIH R00 ES016780, NIH P20 RR020152]; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE [R01CA129925] FUNDING SOURCE: NIH REPORTER; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCES [P20RR020152] FUNDING SOURCE: NIH REPORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES [R01ES028271, R56ES026821, R00ES016780] FUNDING SOURCE: NIH REPORTER; OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH [P51OD011104] FUNDING SOURCE: NIH REPORTER","TULANE UNIVERSITY STEM CELL AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE FACULTY GRANT BRUCE A BUNNELL; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES NIH R01ES028271 ZACHARY F PURSELL; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES NIH R56ES026821 ZACHARY F PURSELL; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES NIH R00 ES016780 ZACHARY F PURSELL; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES NIH P20 RR020152 ZACHARY F PURSELL","2050-084X","ELIFE","ELIFE","ENGLISH","FEB 28","104",NA,"BUNNELL, BRUCE/0000-0001-6196-3722 PURSELL, ZACHARY/0000-0001-5871-7192 LIGHT, NICHOLAS/0000-0003-2021-3938",NA,"ELIFE SCIENCES PUBLICATIONS LTD","LIFE SCIENCES \& BIOMEDICINE - OTHER TOPICS",7,"EXPLOSIVE MUTATION ACCUMULATION TRIGGERED BY HETEROZYGOUS HUMAN POL EPSILON PROOFREADING-DEFICIENCY IS DRIVEN BY SUPPRESSION OF MISMATCH REPAIR","ARTICLE","WOS000426248800001","0","2","7","BIOLOGY","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2018,"PURSELL, ZF (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), TULANE UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT BIOCHEM \& MOL BIOL, 1430 TULANE AVE, NEW ORLEANS, LA 70112 USA","ISI","TULANE UNIV;TULANE UNIV;TULANE UNIV;HOSP SICK CHILDREN;ARTHUR AND SONIA LABATT BRAIN TUMOUR RES CTR;UNIV TORONTO;TULANE UNIV;TULANE UNIV;TULANE UNIV;HOSP SICK CHILDREN;HOSP SICK CHILDREN;UNIV TORONTO;TULANE UNIV;LAB BIOL MOL AND CELLULAIRE EUCARYOTES;LOUISIANA STATE UNIV;UNIV CALIF SAN FRANCISCO","TULANE UNIV","HODEL KP, 2018, ELIFE","HODEL KP, 2018, ELIFE","USA",11,0

THE CRACK DISTRIBUTION AND DAMAGE DEFORMATION OF THE BLAST LOADED GIRDERS ARE SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATED, AND THE BLAST EFFECT ZONE IS PROPOSED TO DESCRIBE THE BLAST LOADING DISTRIBUTIONS ON GIRDERS AND TO CHARACTERIZE THE GIRDER STRUCTURAL BEHAVIOR. THE GIRDER FAILURE IS DOMINATED BY ONE OF THE THREE TYPICAL DAMAGE MECHANISMS: SHEAR, FLEXURAL-SHEAR, AND FLEXURAL, DEPENDING ON THE BLAST EFFECT ZONE WHERE THE GIRDER IS LOCATED. THE STUDY ALSO INDICATES THAT THE ISOLATION EFFECT OF THE VEHICLE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE BLAST LOADING DISTRIBUTION ON STRUCTURES, EVEN THOUGH THE ISOLATION EFFECT IS LOCALIZED IN A REGION WITH A SMALL STANDOFF DISTANCE. IT IS GRADUALLY ATTENUATED BY THE INCREASE OF THE STANDOFF DISTANCE. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS IS CONDUCTED TO VERIFY THE FINDINGS BY SIMULATING THE TRUCK ISOLATION EFFECT WITH A STEEL PLATE.","1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","WUHAN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY; UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE",NA,"LSUN@UCI.EDU","2022-12-01","GO5IE","10.1177/1056789517708827",NA,"1530-7921",NA,NA,"FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR CENTRAL UNIVERSITIES [2013-IV-016]","THE AUTHOR(S) DISCLOSED RECEIPT OF THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE RESEARCH, AUTHORSHIP, AND/OR PUBLICATION OF THIS ARTICLE: THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THIS STUDY IS PROVIDED BY THE FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR CENTRAL UNIVERSITIES (PROJECT NO. 2013-IV-016).","1056-7895","INT.

THE UNIQUE PROPERTIES THAT MAKE ENMS USEFUL ALSO MAKE THEM A HEALTH RISK, AND INDIVIDUALS WITH PRE-EXISTING DISEASES SUCH AS ASTHMA ARE LIKELY MORE SUSCEPTIBLE. THIS REVIEW SUMMARIZES THE CURRENT LITERATURE ON THE ABILITY OF ENMS TO BOTH EXACERBATE AND DIRECTLY CAUSE ASTHMA.RECENT FINDINGSRECENT STUDIES HIGHLIGHT THE ABILITY OF METAL NANOPARTICLES (NPS) AND CARBON NANOTUBES (CNTS) TO NOT ONLY EXACERBATE PRE-EXISTING ASTHMA IN ANIMAL MODELS BUT ALSO INITIATE ALLERGIC AIRWAY DISEASE DIRECTLY. CNTS ALONE ARE SHOWN TO CAUSE AIRWAY MUCUS PRODUCTION, ELEVATED SERUM IGE LEVELS, AND INCREASED T(H)2 CYTOKINE LEVELS, ALL KEY INDICATORS OF ASTHMA.SUMMARYTHE ABILITY OF ENMS TO MODULATE THE IMMUNE RESPONSE IN ASTHMA VARIES DEPENDING ON THEIR PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES AND EXPOSURE TIMING. CNTS CONSISTENTLY EXACERBATE ASTHMA, AS DO NI AND TIO2 NPS, WHEREAS SOME NPS LIKE AU ATTENUATE ASTHMA. EVIDENCE IS STRONG THAT ENMS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ALLERGIC AIRWAY DISEASE; HOWEVER, MORE WORK IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THEIR MECHANISMS, AND MORE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO VALIDATE RESULTS FROM ANIMAL MODELS.","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA; NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY",NA,"MDIHRIE@NCSU.EDU JCBONNER@NCSU.EDU","2022-12-01","VJ1SI","10.1007/s40572-018-0181-4",NA,"2196-5412",NA,NA,"NIEHS [R01ES020897, T32ES007046]; NSF [15-022]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES [R01ES020897, T32ES007046] FUNDING SOURCE: NIH REPORTER","THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FOLLOWING FUNDING SOURCES: NIEHS GRANT R01ES020897 (JCB), NIEHS TRAINING GRANT T32ES007046 (MDH), AND NSF GRANT 15-022 (JCB).",NA,"CURR..

BLUNT FORCE OR EXPLOSIVE BLAST IMPACTING THE BRAIN CAN CAUSE NEUROLOGICAL SEQUELAE THROUGH THE MECHANISMS THAT REMAIN YET TO BE FULLY ELUCIDATED. FOR EXAMPLE, SHOCKWAVES PROPAGATING THROUGH THE BRAIN HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO CREATE A MECHANICAL TRAUMA THAT MAY DISRUPT THE BBB. INDEED, USING TISSUE ENGINEERING APPROACHES, THE SHOCKWAVE-INDUCED MECHANICAL INJURY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO MODULATE THE ORGANIZATION AND PERMEABILITY OF THE ENDOTHELIUM TIGHT JUNCTIONS. BECAUSE AN INJURY TO THE BRAIN ENDOTHELIUM TYPICALLY INDUCES A HIGH EXPRESSION OF ESELECTIN, WE POSTULATED THAT UPREGULATION OF THIS PROTEIN AFTER AN INJURY CAN BE EXPLOITED FOR DIAGNOSIS AND POTENTIAL THERAPY THROUGH TARGETED NANODELIVERY TO THE INJURED BRAIN ENDOTHELIUM. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE ENGINEERED POLY(LACTIC-CO-GLYCOLIC ACID) (PLGA) NANOPARTICLES TO ENCAPSULATE THERAPEUTIC NONBIOLOGICS AND DECORATED THEM WITH LIGANDS TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET THE E-SELECTIN. A HIGH LEVEL OF THE CONJUGATED NANOPARTICLES WAS FOUND INSIDE THE INJURED CELLS. REPAIR OF THE INJURY SITE WAS THEN QUANTITATIVELY MEASURED AND ANALYZED. TO SUMMARIZE, EXPLOITING THE TUNABLE PROPERTIES OF PLGA, A TARGETED DRUG DELIVERY STRATEGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED, WHICH COMBINES THE SPECIFICITY OF LIGAND/ RECEPTOR INTERACTION WITH THERAPEUTIC REAGENTS. SUCH A STRATEGY COULD BE USED TO PROVIDE A POTENTIAL THERAGNOSTIC APPROACH FOR THE TREATMENT OF MODULATED BRAIN ENDOTHELIUM ASSOCIATED WITH TBI.","1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS ARLINGTON",NA,"MICHAEL.CHO@UTA.EDU","2022-12-01","MD1MY","10.1021/acsomega.0c01517",NA,NA,NA,NA,"OFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH [N00014-16-1-2140]; NIH F31 RUTH L.

RECENT FINDINGS FROM OUR LABORATORY SUGGEST THAT SHOCKWAVES PRODUCED BY A BLAST CAN GENERATE MICRON-SIZED BUBBLES IN THE TISSUE. THE COLLAPSE OF MICROBUBBLES (I.E., MICROCAVITATION) MAY INDUCE A MECHANICAL TRAUMA AND COMPROMISE THE INTEGRITY OF THE BLOOD-BRAIN ENDOTHELIUM (BBE). TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS, WE ENGINEERED A BBE MODEL TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF MICROBUBBLES ON THE STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHANGES IN THE BBE. USING MONOLAYERS OF MOUSE PRIMARY BRAIN MICROVASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL CELLS, THE PERMEABILITY COEFFICIENT WAS MEASURED FOLLOWING SIMULATED BLAST-INDUCED MICROCAVITATION. THIS EVENT DOWN-REGULATED THE EXPRESSION OF TIGHT JUNCTION MARKERS, DISORGANIZED THE CELL-CELL JUNCTION, AND INCREASED PERMEABILITY. SINCE POLOXAMERS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO RESCUE DAMAGED CELLS, THE CELLS WERE TREATED WITH THE FDA-APPROVED POLOXAMER 188 (P188). THE RESULTS INDICATE P188 RECOVERED THE PERMEABILITY, RESTORED THE TIGHT JUNCTIONS, AND SUPPRESSED THE EXPRESSIONS OF MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES. THE BIOMIMETIC INTERFACE WE DEVELOPED APPEARS TO PROVIDE A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO REPLICATE THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF BBE, DETERMINE ITS ALTERATION IN RESPONSE TO TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY, AND TEST POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TREATMENTS TO REPAIR THE DAMAGED BRAIN ENDOTHELIUM.","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS ARLINGTON; ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY","3054","MICHAEL.CHO@UTA.EDU","2022-12-01","NF1RQ","10.1038/s41598-020-59888-2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2045-2322","SCI REP","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS","ENGLISH","FEB 20","49","1","CHO, MYOUNG RAE/0000-0002-8191-8045",NA,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS",6,"MODULATION OF IN VITRO BRAIN ENDOTHELIUM BY MECHANICAL TRAUMA: STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL RESTORATION BY POLOXAMER 188","ARTICLE","WOS000563079900038","0","1","10","MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2020,"CHO, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV TEXAS ARLINGTON, DEPT BIOENGN, ARLINGTON, TX 76019 USA","ISI","UNIV TEXAS ARLINGTON;UNIV TEXAS ARLINGTON;ROCHESTER INST TECHNOL","UNIV TEXAS ARLINGTON","INYANG E, 2020, SCI REP","INYANG E, 2020, SCI REP","USA",4,0

HOWEVER, THE LIQUID AEROSOLIZATION PHENOMENON, WHICH INCREASES THE FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARD OF BULK LIQUIDS, HAS NOT BEEN WIDELY RECOGNIZED. THIS WORK AIMS AT IDENTIFYING THE CONTRIBUTORS INFLUENCING LIQUID AEROSOL FLAMMABILITY AND SOLVING THEIR DATA DEFICIENCIES BY DEVELOPING QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE PROPERTY RELATIONSHIP (QSPR) MODELS. 1215 LIQUID CHEMICALS AND 14 PREDICTORS HAVE BEEN INPUT TO TRAIN THE DEVELOPED MACHINE LEARNING MODELS VIA K-FOLD CROSS VALIDATION WITH THE CONSIDERATION OF PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS. THREE ROUNDS OF MODEL PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS ARE CONDUCTED TO FIND THE OPTIMAL MODELS FOR LIQUID DYNAMIC VISCOSITY (LDV), SURFACE TENSION (ST), AND LIQUID VAPOR PRESSURE (LVP). THE MOST PERSUASIVE MODEL FOR LDV IS OBTAINED BY THE EXPONENTIAL GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION ( GPR) APPROACH WITH SEVEN PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS, WHILE THE MATERN 5/2 GPR ALGORITHM IS THE MOST ROBUST MODEL FOR PREDICTING ST AND LVP. DUE TO THEIR GOOD INTERPRETATION AND PREDICTION PERFORMANCE, THE OPTIMIZED MACHINE LEARNING MODELS CAN BE USED TO PREDICT FLAMMABILITY-LEADING PROPERTIES FOR AEROSOLS AND CAN THEREFORE HELP DESIGN INHERENTLY SAFER PROCESSES INVOLVING POTENTIAL LIQUID AEROSOLIZATION.

SUCH ADVANCEMENTS HAVE ENABLED SIMULTANEOUS TARGETING OF TWO CHALLENGES IN ENGINEERED SENSORY ORGANS, ESPECIALLY THE NOSE: I) MECHANICALLY ROBUST RECONSTRUCTION OF THE NASAL CARTILAGE WITH HIGH PRECISION AND II) REPLICATION OF THE NOSE FUNCTIONALITY: ODOR PERCEPTION. HYBRID NASAL ORGANS CAN BE EQUIPPED WITH REMARKABLE CAPABILITIES SUCH AS AUGMENTED OLFACTORY PERCEPTION. HEREIN, A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT FOR AN ODOR-PERCEPTIVE NOSE-LIKE HYBRID, WHICH IS COMPOSED OF A MECHANICALLY ROBUST CARTILAGE-LIKE CONSTRUCT AND A BIOCOMPATIBLE BIOSENSING PLATFORM, IS PROPOSED. SPECIFICALLY, 3D CARTILAGE-LIKE TISSUE CONSTRUCTS ARE CREATED BY MULTI-MATERIAL 3D BIOPRINTING USING MECHANICALLY TUNABLE CHONDROCYTE-LADEN BIOINKS. IN ADDITION, BY OPTIMIZING THE COMPOSITION OF STIFF AND SOFT BIOINKS IN MACRO-SCALE PRINTED CONSTRUCTS, THE COMPETENCE OF THIS SYSTEM IN PROVIDING IMPROVED VIABILITY AND RECAPITULATION OF CHONDROCYTE CELL BEHAVIOR IN MECHANICALLY ROBUST 3D CONSTRUCTS IS DEMONSTRATED. FURTHERMORE, THE ENGINEERED CARTILAGE-LIKE TISSUE CONSTRUCT IS INTEGRATED WITH AN ELECTROCHEMICAL BIOSENSING SYSTEM TO BRING FUNCTIONAL OLFACTORY SENSATIONS TOWARD MULTIPLE SPECIFIC AIRWAY DISEASE BIOMARKERS, EXPLOSIVES, AND TOXINS UNDER BIOCOMPATIBLE CONDITIONS. PROPOSED HYBRID CONSTRUCTS CAN LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR FUNCTIONAL BIONIC INTERFACES AND HUMANOID CYBORGS.","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","HARVARD UNIVERSITY; BRIGHAM \& WOMEN'S HOSPITAL; STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY; TECNOLOGICO DE MONTERREY; TECNOLOGICO DE MONTERREY; JIANGSU UNIVERSITY; SHARIF UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY; UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE CAMPINAS","1901878","MMANNOOR@STEVENS.EDU SSHIN4@BWH.HARVARD.EDU","2022-12-01","KT7VY","10.1002/advs.201901878","JAN 2020","2198-3844",NA,NA,"NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH [R01AR074234, R21EB026824, R01AR073822-01]; BRIGHAM RESEARCH INSTITUTE STEPPING STRONG INNOVATOR AWARD; AHA INNOVATIVE PROJECT AWARD [19IPLOI34660079]","S.R.S.

IN ORDER TO INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF THE MICROSTRUCTURE, AND IN PARTICULAR THE UNDERLYING MATERIAL HETEROGENEITIES THAT INFLUENCE THE BUILD-UP TO DETONATION, A NEW PARADIGM IS PUT FORTH FOR MODELLING SUB-GRID, REACTION-INDUCED FLUCTUATIONS (I. E. ``HOT SPOTS'') AT THE CONTINUUM LEVEL. THIS MODELLING APPROACH ASSUMES THAT THE REACTION RATE IS STOCHASTIC, RATHER THAN DETERMINISTIC, AND IT USES LANGEVIN-TYPE EQUATIONS WITH A MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK BUILT UPON ITO CALCULUS AND LAMBOURN'S CIM MODEL FOR SHOCKED HETEROGENEOUS EXPLOSIVES. THIS APPROACH FOLLOWS DIRECTLY FROM OUR PREVIOUS LETTER, REF. [1], AND IS INSPIRED BY THE PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION (PDF) METHODS USED IN TURBULENT REACTIVE FLOWS. HERE, THE STOCHASTIC BURN MODEL IS DERIVED, IMPLEMENTED, AND EXERCISED FAR BEYOND WHAT HAS BEEN SHOWN IN PREVIOUS WORK. NEW HYDROCODE SIMULATION RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE ROLE OF STOCHASTIC FLUCTUATIONS DURING SHOCK INITIATION; THESE FLUCTUATIONS ARE APPROXIMATED BY COLLECTIONS OF DISCRETE PARTICLES, THAT EVOLVE WITH DRIFT (I. E. DETERMINISTIC) AND DIFFUSION (I. E. STOCHASTIC) COEFFICIENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE PARTICLE VALUES ARE PROPAGATED AND AVERAGED TO CALCULATE THE HEAT RELEASE, YIELD STRENGTH, AND MATERIAL IMPEDANCE IN EACH COMPUTATIONAL CELL. HYDROCODE SIMULATION RESULTS FURTHER SHOW HOW THE FLUCTUATING HOT SPOT ENERGY MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRANSMITTED TO THE WAVE FRONT, AND RESULT IN A DETONATION WAVE-LIKE STRUCTURE. THE FUNDAMENTAL STOCHASTIC NATURE OF THIS MODEL PERMITS SIMULATIONS TO HAVE VARYING OUTCOMES WITH THE SAME INITIAL CONDITIONS; THIS ALLOWS FOR GO/NO-GO ESTIMATION (E. G., MARGINAL OR FAILED DETONATIONS), WHICH MIGHT POSSIBLY BE CALIBRATED USING THE STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS FROM REAL MATERIALS. MESOSCALE CALCULATIONS OF SHOCKED HETEROGENEOUS EXPLOSIVES ALSO SHOW THAT THESE FLUCTUATIONS ARE PHYSICALLY JUSTIFIED (I. E., REF. [2]), AND IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE PDF FUNCTIONS PROVIDE A LINK BETWEEN THE MESO(GRAIN) AND CONTINUUM SCALES FOR PRACTICAL ENGINEERING CALCULATIONS. THUS, OUR APPROACH IS A PARADIGM SHIFT FOR BUILDING EFFICIENT, REDUCED ORDER CONTINUUM BURN MODELS, THAT REPRESENT THE SUB-GRID STOCHASTIC BEHAVIOUR OF SHOCKED HETEROGENEOUS SOLID EXPLOSIVES.","POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY","UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE); SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES",NA,"DEKITTE@SANDIA.GOV","2022-12-01","KQ0WK","10.1002/prep.201900209","NOV 2019","1521-4087",NA,NA,"LABORATORY DIRECTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AT SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION [DE-NA0003525]","THE AUTHORS WISH TO THANK MIKE HOBBS, BILL ERIKSON, ROBERT KNEPPER, AND JUDY BROWN (SNL) FOR MANY USEFUL DISCUSSIONS AND CRITIQUES OF THE WORK.

A COHERENT TYPE OF SEISMIC SOURCE ACHIEVES A HIGHER RESOLUTION, HENCE A SHARPER IMAGE OF DEEP LAYERS. IN THE UPPER-FREQUENCY RANGE OF SEISMIC SIGNALS (HIGHER THAN 16 HZ), MARINE VIBRATORS CAN SUCCESSFULLY APPLY THE KNOWN ACOUSTIC TECHNOLOGY OF LOW-FREQUENCY UNDERWATER TRANSDUCERS. THIS TECHNOLOGY IS NOT AS EFFECTIVE AT LOW SEISMIC FREQUENCIES. THE SLOW PROGRESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY REQUIRES FINDING A DIFFERENT APPROACH. AN ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO EMPLOY A GAS-FILLED UNDERWATER CYLINDRICAL BUBBLE RESONATOR. A LARGE GAS-FILLED RESONANCE BUBBLE COVERED WITH AN ELASTIC MEMBRANE AND DRIVEN BY A BLOWER WITH AIRFLOW CONTROLLED BY A PROPORTIONAL VALVE PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT POWER IN THE LOW-FREQUENCY RANGE. WE ACHIEVED A SUITABLE BROADBAND FREQUENCY RESPONSE BY DESIGNING A DOUBLE RESONANCE SYSTEM CONSISTING OF A BUBBLE AND AN INTERNAL HELMHOLTZ GAS ACOUSTIC RESONATOR.

HOWEVER, SUCH RELIABLE LARGE EXPERIMENTAL DATASET IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. BESIDES, THE ML ALGORITHMS NEED TO ABIDE BY THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF PHYSICS TO AVOID NONPHYSICAL PREDICTIONS. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, THIS PAPER SYNERGISTICALLY INTEGRATES ML WITH HIGHTHROUGHPUT MULTISCALE FINITE ELEMENT (FE) SIMULATIONS TO PREDICT THE RESPONSE OF COATED COMPOSITE CYLINDERS SUBJECTED TO NEARFIELD UNDERWATER EXPLOSION. THE SIMULATED RESPONSES FROM THE MULTISCALE APPROACH CORRELATE VERY WELL WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS. AFTER VALIDATION OF THE MULTISCALE APPROACH, A REPRESENTATIVE AND CONSISTENT DATASET CONTAINING MORE THAN 3800 COMBINATIONS IS DEVELOPED USING HIGH-THROUGHPUT MULTISCALE SIMULATION BY VARYING THE FIBER/MATRIX/COATING MATERIAL PROPERTIES, COATING THICKNESS AS WELL AS EXPERIMENTAL VARIABLES SUCH AS EXPLOSIVE ENERGY AND STAND-OFF DISTANCE. THE DATASET IS LEVERAGED TO PREDICT THE RESPONSE OF COATED COMPOSITE CYLINDERS SUBJECTED TO NEARFIELD UNDERWATER EXPLOSION USING A FEED-FORWARD MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON-BASED NEURAL NETWORK (NN) APPROACH WHICH SHOWS EXCELLENT PREDICTIONS.

IN MANY CASES, EXPLOSIONS MAY OCCUR IN CONFINED AREAS WITH OBSTACLES IN THE PATH OF FLAME EXPANSION. BY STUDYING THE EFFECTS OF OBSTACLE SHAPE, TURBULENCE MODEL, AND SPARK LOCATION ON FLAME PROPAGATION AND TURBULENCE, A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FLAME AND FLUID DYNAMICS INTERACTION HAS BEEN ACHIEVED. REYNOLDS AVERAGED NAVIER-STOKES (RANS) MODELS WERE TESTED TO DETERMINE IF THESE SIMPLIFIED TURBULENCE MODELS COULD CAPTURE THE FLAME DYNAMICS AND PROPAGATION VELOCITIES USING FEWER COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES COMPARED TO THE HIGHER FIDELITY LARGE EDDY SIMULATION (LES) TURBULENCE MODEL. RESULTS SHOWED THAT SQUARE OBSTACLES CAUSED FASTER FLAME PROPAGATION COMPARED TO HEXAGONS AND CIRCLES. THE SQUARE HAD AN AVERAGE FLAME PROPAGATION VELOCITY 26 \% FASTER THAN THE CIRCLE, AND THE HEXAGON WAS 16 \% FASTER THAN THE CIRCLE USING A K-OMEGA MODEL. MODELING RESULTS INDICATE VARIATION OF SPARK LOCATION BY AS SMALL AS 10 \% OF THE OBSTACLE DIAMETER CAN RESULT IN A DIFFERENCE OF THE FLAME PROPAGATION. FINDINGS ON TURBULENCE MODEL ACCURACY AND COMPUTATIONAL TIME ALONG WITH SHAPE COMPARISON CAN BE APPLIED IN FUTURE MODELING OF LARGE SYSTEMS, PROVIDING CRUCIAL INFORMATION FOR SAFETY PLANNING AND EXPLOSION PREVENTION.

THIS PAPER WILL ANALYZE HYDRATED LIME EFFECTS ON SOIL PH AND THE DEGRADATION OF MUNITIONS CONSTITUENTS WITH TIME. AT ONE DOD HAND GRENADE TRAINING RANGE, LIME TREATMENT PRODUCED HIGHER SOIL PH VALUES AND RDX CONCENTRATION REDUCTIONS BY EIGHT ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, SOME ACHIEVED CONCENTRATIONS IN THE LOW PARTS PER TRILLION (PPT). THE PRESENCE OF CALCITE (CAO), A REACTION PRODUCT OF CA(OH)(2), IN FIELD SAMPLES CONFIRMED THAT ALKALINE HYDROLYSIS REACTIONS OCCURRED IN THE SOIL MATRIX. IN TOTAL, 5 MONTHS AFTER THE ADDITION OF LIME TO RANGE SOILS, RDX WAS DETECTED IN COLLECTED FIELD SAMPLES IN SMALL QUANTITIES.

DETECTION OF FAULT (ESPECIALLY ACTIVE FAULTS) IS THE FIRST STEP TO CONDUCT ANY FURTHER IN-DEPTH STUDIES IN FAULTED ROCK MASS OR ROCK BLOCKS. IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATED THE PLAUSIBILITY TO IMAGE FAULT ZONES BY PASSIVE SEISMIC SURVEYS USING RECORDED AMBIENT NOISE. THE TEST SITE IS IN THE NORTH SUBURB OF BEIJING, NORTHERN CHINA ALONG THE SOUTH BANK OF THE NORTHWEST-SOUTHEAST RUNNING WENYUHE RIVER, WHERE THE NNE-STRIKING HUANGZHUANG-GAOLIYING FAULT (HGF, ACTIVE IN THE HOLOCENE) IS CROSSING. IN GENERAL, THE RESULTS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES USING ACTIVE SOURCE SEISMICS CONDUCTED IN THIS AREA ALONG THE HGF AND EXISTING BOREHOLE DRILLINGS IN THE VICINITY. UNDOUBTEDLY, ACTIVE SOURCE SEISMIC REFLECTION TECHNIQUE IS THE BEST TECHNIQUE TO IMAGE FAULT IN DEPTH WITH HIGH RESOLUTION. THE DRAWBACK IS ITS HIGH COST AND THE NECESSITY OF USING EXPLOSIVES, A PRACTICE USUALLY PROHIBITED IN URBAN SETTINGS. IN CONTRAST, PASSIVE SEISMIC SURVEYS TAKE THE ADVANTAGE OF THE EVER-EXISTING AMBIENT NOISE SOURCE, AND PROVIDE A LOW-COST TECHNIQUE, AND FAST DEPLOYMENT THAT CAN LOCATE THE FAULT EFFECTIVELY. THOUGH THE IMAGING RESOLUTION IS LOWER COMPARED TO THOSE OBTAINED BY ACTIVE SOURCE SEISMIC SURVEYS, OUR PASSIVE SEISMIC EXPERIMENT AT THE WENYUHE RIVER SITE DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS APPROACH IS EFFECTIVE, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE FAULTS WITH SIGNIFICANT NORMAL FAULTING COMPONENT AND THE STRATIGRAPHY IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ON THE TWO SIDES CROSSING THE FAULT LINE.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","CHINA UNIVERSITY OF GEOSCIENCES; UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT","105520","RONGYIQIAN@CUGB.AC.CN LANBO.LIU@UCONN.EDU","2022-12-01","LC5VG","10.1016/j.enggeo.2020.105520",NA,"1872-6917",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0013-7952","ENG.

MOREOVER, MANY IOT DEVICES INCORPORATE A MANUFACTURER-OWNED CLOUD-BASED BACK-END SUPPORT TO PROCESS AND STORE THE GENERATED DATA WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES. CLEARLY, IN SUCH AN INDUSTRY-DRIVEN ENVIRONMENT WITH THE DESIRE TO USE THE IOT DATA AS A REVENUE STREAM, IT IS A CHALLENGE FOR USERS TO CONTROL IOT DATA. DEVICE MANUFACTURERS UTILIZE AN OPAQUE SOFTWARE DESIGN WHERE USER DATA IS GENERATED AND STORED WITH LITTLE TRANSPARENCY. MANUFACTURERS USE EULAS AS A LEGAL CONSTRUCT TO PROTECT A MANUFACTURER'S LEGAL STANDING AND TO EXPLAIN A DEVICE'S BEHAVIOR, HOWEVER THIS EXPLANATION IS VAGUE AND LACKS THE NECESSARY DETAILS FOR A USER TO DETERMINE A DEVICE'S ACCEPTABLE USE AND IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR USERS TO SECURE AND MAINTAIN THEIR DATA. FORTUNATELY, AS THE PRIVACY MINDED USER BASE OF IOT DEVICES GROWS, THE MANUFACTURERS WILL BE FORCED TO IMPLEMENT A NEW FRAMEWORK THAT CAN ENABLE USERS TO HAVE MORE CONTROL ON THE CREATION OF THEIR IOT DATA, AND TO STORE/DISSEMINATE SUCH DATA IN A SECURE AND PRIVATE MANNER. IN THIS PAPER, WE ADDRESS THIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY FROM MANUFACTURERS AND ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF PRIVACY AND SECURITY BY PROPOSING A NEW FRAMEWORK CALLED BULWARK, FOR MANUFACTURER USE ON IOT DEVICES AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS. PROPOSED FRAMEWORK ENABLES THE USER TO GENERATE AND MANAGE A SET OF DATA CONTROLLING RULES, AND STORE THE RESULT IN THEIR PERSONAL CLOUD ACCOUNT, WHILE PROVIDING A DASHBOARD DATA REPORTING TOOL ENABLING DATA TRANSPARENCY AND SUPPORTING GOOD USER CHOICES. THE USER'S ABILITY TO ACCESS, DISSEMINATE AND SECURE IOT GENERATED DATA, IS NOW AVAILABLE WITHIN OUR PROPOSED FRAMEWORK. USING REVERSE ENGINEERING, SIMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OPEN SOURCE SOLUTIONS, WE DEMONSTRATE SUPPORT FOR A SET OF COMMON DEVICES. EACH DEVICE EXECUTED THE FRAMEWORK, WHILE COMMUNICATING WITH A MOBILE APPLICATION AND CLOUD SERVICES. RULES WERE GENERATED FOR EACH MESSAGE AND TELEMETRY WAS RETURNED TO THE MOBILE APPLICATION FOR DASHBOARD RENDERING. WE STORED GENERATED DATA IN THE CLOUD USING OUR OWN ACCOUNT, WHILE MAINTAINING THE FREE TIER FOR EACH OF THE CLOUD SERVICES. NETWORK USAGE INCREASED BETWEEN 4\% AND 9\% WHILE STORAGE SIZE GREW BETWEEN 0\% AND 2\% LARGER, AS COMPARED TO USING THE DEVICE WITHOUT THE FRAMEWORK.

ALUMINUM ALLOY CYLINDERS WERE PACKED WITH COMPOSITION C-4 EXPLOSIVE AND END-DETONATED TO OBSERVE NATURAL FRAGMENTATION BEHAVIOR IN REPRESENTATIVE GEOMETRIES. A ``LOW'' PRESSURE CONDITION WAS INDUCED IN THE EMBRITTLED MATERIAL BY INSERTING A POLYCARBONATE BUFFER BETWEEN THE EXPLOSIVES AND INNER CYLINDER WALL. OTHER TESTS FEATURED THE EXPLOSIVES IN INTIMATE CONTACT WITH THE CYLINDER WALLS TO INVESTIGATE A ``HIGH'' PRESSURE CONDITION. RESULTS INDICATED THAT EMBRITTLED ALUMINUM CYLINDERS FRAGMENT INTO SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER PARTICLES COMPARED TO NON-EMBRITTLED CYLINDERS AT BOTH HIGH AND LOW-PRESSURE CONDITIONS.

DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTROLLING GROUND VIBRATIONS, THE MINING INDUSTRY COMMONLY USES EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGIES BASED ON CONCEPTS RELATED TO THE NUCLEAR TESTS ERA (CHARGE WEIGHT SCALING RELATIONSHIPS). OVER THE PAST DECADE, ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO POPULARIZE MORE ELABORATE METHODOLOGIES. THESE METHODS RANGE FROM BASIC WAVEFORM SUPERPOSITION TO ANALYTICAL AND NUMERICAL METHODS. SUCH METHODOLOGIES ARE DIFFICULT TO UTILIZE DAILY BECAUSE OF THEIR COMPLEXITY, SOMETIMES LOW ACCURACY (DESPITE THEIR SOPHISTICATION), REQUIREMENT FOR DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN PARAMETERS, AND TIME NEEDED TO REACH SOLUTIONS USING COMPLEX ALGORITHMS. IN THIS PAPER, A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY TO CONTROL AND PREDICT GROUND VIBRATIONS FROM BLASTING IS PRESENTED. THIS METHODOLOGY USES A SEMI-EMPIRICAL APPROACH, WHERE THE GENERATION AND PROPAGATION OF GROUND VIBRATION WAVES AND THE GROUND VIBRATION CHARACTERISTICS AT A POINT OF INTEREST ARE CONSIDERED THROUGH THE COLLECTION OF A SIGNATURE WAVEFORM.

WE CONSIDER THE PROBLEM OF FINDING THE OPTIMAL ORDER OF REPAIRING ELEMENTS IN POWER GRIDS AND SIMILAR INFRASTRUCTURE. MOST EXISTING METHODS EITHER ONLY CONSIDER SYSTEM NETWORK STRUCTURE, POTENTIALLY IGNORING IMPORTANT FEATURES, OR INCORPORATE COMPONENT LEVEL DETAILS LEADING TO COMPLEX OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS WITH LIMITED SCALABILITY. WE AIM TO NARROW THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO APPROACHES. ANALYZING REALISTIC RECOVERY STRATEGIES, WE IDENTIFY OVER- AND UNDERSUPPLY PENALTIES OF COMMODITIES AS PRIMARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO RECONSTRUCTION COST, AND WE DEMONSTRATE TRADITIONAL NETWORK SCIENCE METHODS, WHICH MAXIMIZE THE LARGEST CONNECTED COMPONENT, ARE COST INEFFICIENT. WE PROPOSE A NOVEL COMPETITIVE PERCOLATION RECOVERY MODEL ACCOUNTING FOR NODE DEMAND AND SUPPLY, AND NETWORK STRUCTURE. OUR MODEL WELL APPROXIMATES REALISTIC RECOVERY STRATEGIES, SUPPRESSING GROWTH OF THE LARGEST CONNECTED COMPONENT THROUGH A PROCESS ANALOGOUS TO EXPLOSIVE PERCOLATION. USING SYNTHETIC POWER GRIDS, WE INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS ON RECOVERY PROCESS EFFICIENCY. WE LEARN THAT HIGH STRUCTURAL REDUNDANCY ENABLES REDUCED TOTAL COST AND FASTER RECOVERY, HOWEVER, REQUIRES MORE INFORMATION AT EACH RECOVERY STEP.

THE CATALYTIC EFFICIENCY OF P450S IN THESE NON-NATIVE TRANSFORMATIONS IS HOWEVER SIGNIFICANTLY INFERIOR TO THAT EXHIBITED BY THESE ENZYMES IN THEIR NATIVE MONOOXYGENASE FUNCTION. USING A MECHANISM-GUIDED STRATEGY, WE REPORT HERE THE RATIONAL DESIGN OF A SERIES OF P450(BM3)-BASED VARIANTS WITH DRAMATICALLY ENHANCED C-H AMINATION ACTIVITY ACQUIRED THROUGH DISRUPTION OF THE NATIVE PROTON RELAY NETWORK AND OTHER HIGHLY CONSERVED STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS WITHIN THIS CLASS OF ENZYMES. THIS APPROACH FURTHER GUIDED THE IDENTIFICATION OF XPLA AND BEZE, TWO ``ATYPICAL'' NATURAL P450S IMPLICATED IN THE DEGRADATION OF A MAN-MADE EXPLOSIVE AND IN BENZASTATINS BIOSYNTHESIS, RESPECTIVELY, AS VERY EFFICIENT C-H AMINASES. BOTH XPLA AND BEZE COULD BE ENGINEERED TO FURTHER IMPROVE THEIR C-H AMINATION REACTIVITY, WHICH DEMONSTRATES THEIR EVOLVABILITY FOR ABIOLOGICAL REACTIONS. THESE ENGINEERED AND NATURAL P450 CATALYSTS CAN PROMOTE THE INTRAMOLECULAR C-H AMINATION OF ARYLSULFONYL AZIDES WITH OVER 10 000-14 000 CATALYTIC TURNOVERS, RANKING AMONG THE MOST EFFICIENT NITRENE TRANSFER BIOCATALYSTS REPORTED TO DATE. MECHANISTIC AND STRUCTURE-REACTIVITY STUDIES PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO THE ORIGIN OF THE C-H AMINATION REACTIVITY ENHANCEMENT AND HIGHLIGHT THE DIVERGENT STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS INHERENT TO SUPPORTING C-H AMINATION VERSUS C-H MONOOXYGENATION REACTIVITY WITHIN THIS CLASS OF ENZYMES. OVERALL, THIS WORK PROVIDES NEW PROMISING SCAFFOLDS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NITRENE TRANSFERASES AND DEMONSTRATES THE VALUE OF MECHANISM-DRIVEN RATIONAL DESIGN AS A STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING THE CATALYTIC EFFICIENCY OF METALLOENZYMES IN THE CONTEXT OF ABIOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATIONS.","1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER",NA,"RFASAN@UR.ROCHESTER.EDU","2022-12-01","MA1NX","10.1021/jacs.9b12859",NA,"1520-5126",NA,NA,"U.S. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [CHE-1609550]; U.S. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH (NIH) [GM098628]; U.S. NSF [CHE-0946653]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE U.S. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION GRANT CHE-1609550 AND IN PART BY THE U.S. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH (NIH) GRANT GM098628.

WATER IS ONE SUCH NATURAL RESOURCE, AND WILL NEED TO BE TREATED AND TRANSPORTED TO MAXIMIZE RESOURCE EFFICIENCY. IN PARTICULAR, WASTEWATER WILL BE MINED FOR THE VALUABLE PRODUCT PRECURSORS IT CONTAINS, WHICH WILL REQUIRE HIGHLY SELECTIVE SEPARATION PROCESSES CAPABLE OF CAPTURING SPECIFIC TARGET COMPOUNDS FROM COMPLEX SOLUTIONS. AS A CASE STUDY, WE FOCUS ON THE NITROGEN CYCLE BECAUSE IT PLAYS A CENTRAL ROLE IN BOTH NATURAL AND ENGINEERED SYSTEMS. NITROGEN OCCURS AS SEVERAL SPECIES, INCLUDING AMMONIA, A FERTILIZER AND PRECURSOR TO MANY NITROGEN PRODUCTS, AND NITRATE, A FERTILIZER AND COMPONENT OF EXPLOSIVES. WE DESCRIBE TWO APPLICATIONS OF SELECTIVE SEPARATIONS: SELECTIVE MATERIALS AND ELECTROCHEMICAL PROCESSES. ULTIMATELY, THIS PERSPECTIVE OUTLINES THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS OF MODULAR, SELECTIVE, RESOURCE-EFFICIENT SEPARATIONS THAT WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN ENABLING ELEMENT-SPECIFIC CIRCULAR ECONOMIES AND REDEFINING WASTEWATER AS A RESOURCE.

HIGHLY FOCUSED SPOTS OF 10 MU M YIELDS FLUENCES OF 0.004 TO 25 KJ/CM(2) AND IRRADIANCES SPANNING 4 X 10(6)-10(14) W/CM(2). SINGLE PULSE HOLE DEPTHS RANGE FROM 84 NM TO 147 MU M. A ONE-DIMENSIONAL THERMAL MODEL ESTABLISHES A SET OF NONDIMENSIONAL VARIABLES FOR HOLE DEPTH, FLUENCE, AND PULSE DURATION. FOR PULSE DURATIONS SHORTER THAN THE RADIAL DIFFUSION TIME, THE HOLE DEPTH EXCEEDS THE THERMAL DIFFUSION LENGTH BY A FACTOR OF 1 TO 30 FOR MORE THAN 90\% OF THE DATA. FOR PULSES LONGER THAN THIS CRITICAL TIME, TRANSVERSE HEAT CONDUCTION LOSSES DOMINATE AND HOLES AS SMALL AS 10(-3) TIMES THE THERMAL DIFFUSION DEPTH ARE PRODUCED. FOR ALL CASES, THE ABLATION EFFICIENCY, DEFINED AS ATOMS REMOVED PER INCIDENT PHOTON, IS 10(-2) OR LESS, AND IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO VOLUME REMOVED FOR PULSE DURATIONS LESS THAN 100 NS. AT HIGH FLUENCES, MORE THAN 10 TO 100 TIMES ABLATION THRESHOLD, EXPLOSIVE BOILING IS IDENTIFIED AS THE LIKELY MASS REMOVAL MECHANISM, AND HOLE DEPTH SCALES APPROXIMATELY AS FLUENCE TO 0.3 TO 0.4 POWER. THE POWER-LAW EXPONENT IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE SHIELDING OF THE LASER PULSE BY EJECTED MATERIAL, AND SHIELDING IS MAXIMUM AT THE 1-NS PULSE DURATION AND MINIMUM NEAR THE 1-MU S PULSE DURATION FOR EACH MATERIAL.

IN PARTICULAR, ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF FACILITIES ARE CAPABLE OF BLAST TESTING OF LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURES. IN CONTRAST, MANY STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING AND STRUCTURAL CONTROL RESEARCH PROJECTS NOW EMPLOY SHAKE-TABLE TESTING. WITH THIS IN MIND, THE AUTHORS HAVE DEVELOPED A TECHNIQUE TO EXPERIMENTALLY SIMULATE THE GLOBAL RESPONSE OF A LARGE-SCALE, FLEXIBLE STRUCTURE SUBJECTED TO BLAST LOADING USING A SHAKE-TABLE-PRODUCED GROUND MOTION. A GROUND MOTION PROFILE DESIGNED FOR EXPERIMENTAL BLAST SIMULATION IS PROPOSED, AND AN ALGORITHM FOR SHAPING THIS GROUND MOTION, BASED ON NEAR EQUIVALENCE OF MODAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION, IS PRESENTED. VALIDATION IS PERFORMED THROUGH A SET OF EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ON A LABORATORY-SCALE NINE-STORY STRUCTURE OUTFITTED WITH A PASSIVE NONLINEAR STRUCTURAL CONTROL SYSTEM. IN THE FIRST PART OF THE VALIDATION, EXPLOSIVE BLAST TESTING OF THE STRUCTURE WAS PERFORMED AT THE US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, ENGINEERING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER, BIG BLACK TEST SITE; AND IN THE SECOND PART, SHAKE-TABLE TESTING OF THE SAME STRUCTURE USING A SYNTHESIZED GROUND MOTION WAS PERFORMED AT THE US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, ENGINEERING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER, CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING RESEARCH LABORATORY. COMPARISON OF THE TWO STUDIES DEMONSTRATES THAT AN APPROPRIATELY DESIGNED, SHAKE-TABLE-PRODUCED GROUND MOTION CAN BE EMPLOYED TO EXPERIMENTALLY SIMULATE THE GLOBAL RESPONSE OF A STRUCTURE SUBJECTED TO BLAST LOADING WITH REASONABLE ACCURACY WITH AND WITHOUT A NONLINEAR STRUCTURAL CONTROL SYSTEM.","THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE; UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS URBANA-CHAMPAIGN; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE; UNITED STATES ARMY; U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS; U.S. ARMY ENGINEER RESEARCH \& DEVELOPMENT CENTER (ERDC); CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING RESEARCH LABORATORY (CERL); UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS URBANA-CHAMPAIGN; UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF OHIO; UNIVERSITY OF AKRON; UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS URBANA-CHAMPAIGN","E2480","NWIERSCH@UTK.EDU","2022-12-01","KD5TO","10.1002/stc.2480","NOV 2019","1545-2263",NA,NA,"DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY [HR0011-10-1-0077]","DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY, GRANT/AWARD NUMBERS: HR0011-10-1-0077 AND HR0011-10-1-0077","1545-2255","STRUCT.

OECTS CONTAIN ELECTRONICALLY ACTIVE POLYMER LAYERS WHOSE CHARGE TRANSPORT PROPERTIES CAN BE MODULATED BY ELECTROLYTES POSSESSING ION CONCENTRATIONS AS LOW AS 1 MU M. HOWEVER, STANDARD OECTS TYPICALLY SUFFER FROM A LACK OF SELECTIVITY TO ELECTROLYTE COMPOSITION, A PREREQUISITE FOR VIABLE IMPLEMENTATION INTO ION-SENSING APPLICATIONS. TO INTRODUCE THIS NEEDED SPECIES SELECTIVITY, WE HAVE INCORPORATED A MOLECULARLY IMPRINTED POLYMER (MIP) INTO AN OECT EMPLOYING A POLY(3,4-ETHYLENE DIOXYTHIOPHENE) AND POLY(STYRENE SULFONATE) POLYMER BLEND (PEDOT:PSS) AS THE CHANNEL ACTIVE LAYER MATERIAL. THE MIP-OECTS WERE CHALLENGED WITH THREE CATIONS: THE SODIUM ION, THE AMMONIUM ION, AND THE TETRABUTYLAMMONIUM ION. THE MIP DID NOT LIMIT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OECT WHEN GATED WITH ELECTROLYTES CONTAINING SODIUM IONS, BUT THE BARRIER DID REDUCE THE GATING CAPABILITIES OF ELECTROLYTES CONTAINING AMMONIUM IONS AND TETRABUTYLAMMONIUM IONS DUE TO SIZE-EXCLUSION EFFECTS. IN PARTICULAR, THE MIP-OECT WAS NOT RESPONSIVE TO TETRABUTYLAMMONIUM IONS AT CONCENTRATIONS UP TO 1 MM. ADDITIONALLY, ELECTROLYTE MIXTURES WERE USED TO TEST THE POTENTIAL FOR INTERFERENCE IN MIP-OECTS. AMMONIUM IONS PRODUCED NEGLIGIBLE INTERFERENCE WHEN DETECTING SODIUM IONS; HOWEVER, TETRABUTYLAMMONIUM IONS COMPLETELY SUPPRESSED THE GATING CAPABILITIES OF SODIUM IONS. THIS MIP-OECT PLATFORM DEMONSTRATES HOW ELECTROLYTE GATING CAN BE ENGINEERED TO EXHIBIT GREATER SELECTIVITY SUCH THAT MIP-COATED OECTS CAN BE UTILIZED AS ADVANCED SENSOR TECHNOLOGIES.","1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","PURDUE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM; PURDUE UNIVERSITY; PURDUE UNIVERSITY WEST LAFAYETTE CAMPUS; PURDUE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM; PURDUE UNIVERSITY; PURDUE UNIVERSITY WEST LAFAYETTE CAMPUS; PURDUE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM; PURDUE UNIVERSITY; PURDUE UNIVERSITY WEST LAFAYETTE CAMPUS",NA,"BOUDOURIS@PURDUE.EDU SBEAUDOI@PURDUE.EDU","2022-12-01","4N3KQ","10.1021/acsapm.2c01030","AUG 2022",NA,NA,NA,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) NATIONAL ROBOTICS INITIATIVE (NRI) [1925194]; NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [DGE-1842166]","THIS WORK WAS PRIMARILY SUPPORTED THROUGH THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) NATIONAL ROBOTICS INITIATIVE (NRI) UNDER AWARD 1925194.

THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THIS PARADIGM HAVE BEEN THE PRODUCT OF AN OVERSIMPLIFIED AND OFTEN LAYMAN-BASED PERCEPTIONS OF THE STUDIED ORGAN OVER THE YEARS. THESE PERCEPTIONS DROVE THE CURRENT DEFINITIONS OF NORMALITY AND ABNORMALITY, PARAMETERS USED IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF THE DISEASE, GOALS OF TREATMENT AND STUDIED OUTCOMES. DESPITE THE EXPLOSIVE ADVANCEMENT IN TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY CHANGED OUR `UPSTREAM' THINKING, PRACTITIONERS REMAIN CAPTIVES OF THESE OLD BELIEFS AND HAVE STREAMLINED CURRENT TECHNOLOGY IN A `DOWNSTREAM' FASHION; IN THE FORM OF GOAL-DIRECTED PROTOCOLS, AND ENGINEERING SYSTEMS THAT WOULD STUDY THEIR IMPLEMENTATIONS. AS A RESULT, DISEASES CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, BECOME MORE RESISTANT TO THERAPY, LATE TO DIAGNOSE, AND WITH A PERSISTENT WORSENING OF OUTCOMES. WITH A PRIMARILY FOCUS ON THE HEART AND FROM AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST PROSPECTIVE, WE CHALLENGE THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE CURRENT PARADIGM FROM AN `UPSTREAM' PROSPECTIVE. WE CHALLENGE THE CURRENT `TERRITORIAL' DEFINITIONS OF THE ORGANS STUDIED, THE CURRENT TERMINOLOGY OF SOME DISEASES, THE PARAMETERS USED IN THEIR DIAGNOSIS, THE DIAGNOSTIC MODALITIES USED AND THEIR GOALS OF TREATMENT. WE ILLUSTRATE SOME EXAMPLES WHEN THE CURRENT COLLECTIVE `MYTH' MEETS THE `REALITY' IN AN ACUTE CARE SETTING, FURTHER CLARIFYING THE LIMITATIONS OF THE CURRENT PARADIGM. WE ALSO, PROVIDE A THEORETICAL HYPOTHESIS OF WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE A POTENTIAL SUBSTITUTE OF THE CURRENT PARADIGM. OUR THEORY REDEFINES DISEASE FROM AN ORGAN-BASED FUNCTIONAL PHENOMENON TO A STRUCTURAL-BASED TISSUE PHENOMENON, CALLING FOR AN INTEGRATIVE AND HOLISTIC APPROACH OF TISSUE ASSESSMENT RATHER THAN A DISCRETE APPROACH THAT MAY POTENTIALLY OBSCURE THE INTERACTION OF NON-APPRAISED ORGANS. WE ALSO BELIEVE IN REDIRECTING TECHNOLOGY IN AN UPSTREAM DIRECTION TO BETTER REDEFINE AND EARLY DETECT DISEASES RATHER THAN SUBMITTING TO GENERATIONALLY INHERITED BELIEFS.

PHYTOREMEDIATION IS AN APPROACH THAT COULD BE USED TO CLEAN-UP EXPLOSIVE POLLUTION, BUT IT IS HINDERED BY INHERENTLY LOW IN PLANTA RDX DEGRADATION RATES, AND THE HIGH PHYTOTOXICITY OF TNT. THE BACTERIAL GENES, XPLA AND XPLB, CONFER THE ABILITY TO DEGRADE RDX IN PLANTS, AND A BACTERIAL NITROREDUCTASE GENE NFSI ENHANCES THE CAPACITY OF PLANTS TO WITHSTAND AND DETOXIFY TNT. WHILE THE PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE USED MODEL PLANT SPECIES TO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFICACY OF THIS TECHNOLOGY, TRIALS USING PLANT SPECIES ABLE TO THRIVE IN THE CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENTS FOUND ON MILITARY TRAINING RANGES ARE NOW URGENTLY NEEDED. PERENNIAL WESTERN WHEATGRASS (PASCOPYRUM SMITHII) IS A UNITED STATES NATIVE SPECIES THAT IS BROADLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS NORTH AMERICA, WELL-SUITED FOR PHYTOREMEDIATION, AND USED BY THE US MILITARY TO RE-VEGETATE MILITARY RANGES. HERE, WE PRESENT THE FIRST REPORT OF THE GENETIC TRANSFORMATION OF WESTERN WHEATGRASS. PLANT LINES TRANSFORMED WITH XPLA, XPLB, AND NFSI REMOVED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RDX FROM HYDROPONIC SOLUTIONS AND RETAINED MUCH LOWER, OR UNDETECTABLE, LEVELS OF RDX IN THEIR LEAF TISSUES WHEN COMPARED TO WILD-TYPE PLANTS. FURTHERMORE, THESE PLANTS WERE ALSO MORE RESISTANT TO TNT TOXICITY, AND DETOXIFIED MORE TNT THAN WILD-TYPE PLANTS. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO ENGINEER A FIELD-APPLICABLE GRASS SPECIES CAPABLE OF BOTH RDX DEGRADATION AND TNT DETOXIFICATION. TOGETHER, THESE FINDINGS PRESENT A PROMISING BIOTECHNOLOGICAL APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLY CONTAIN, REMOVE RDX AND TNT FROM TRAINING RANGE SOIL AND PREVENT GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION.","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON; UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SEATTLE; UNIVERSITY OF YORK - UK",NA,"SSTRAND@UW.EDU","2022-12-01","HP3LM","10.1007/s00425-018-3057-9",NA,"1432-2048",NA,NA," [US DOD SERDP ER-1498]; [ESTCP ER-201436]","THE AUTHORS DECLARE NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

BEING ABLE TO REACT QUICKLY AND INTELLIGENTLY TO FAST-CHANGING MARKETS IS A DECISIVE SUCCESS FACTOR FOR TRADING COMPANIES. TO DATE, THE RISE OF QF REQUIRES AN INTEGRATED TOOLCHAIN OF ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES TO CARRY OUT COMPLEX EVENT PROCESSING ON THE EXPLOSIVE GROWTH AND DIVERSIFIED FORMS OF MARKET METADATA, IN PURSUIT OF A MICROSECOND LATENCY ON AN EXABYTE-LEVEL DATASET. INSPIRED BY THIS, WE PRESENT A DATA-DRIVEN EXECUTION PARADIGM THAT UNTANGLES THE DEPENDENCIES OF COMPLEX PROCESSING EVENTS AND INTEGRATE THE PARADIGM WITH A BIG DATA INFRASTRUCTURE THAT STREAMS TIME SERIES DATA. THIS INTEGRATED PLATFORM IS TERMED AS THE QUANTCLOUD PLATFORM. ESSENTIALLY, QUANTCLOUD EXECUTES THE COMPLEX EVENT PROCESSING IN A DATA-DRIVEN MODE AND MANAGES LARGE AMOUNTS OF DIVERSIFIED MARKET DATA IN A DATA-PARALLEL MODE. TO SHOW ITS PRACTICABILITY AND PERFORMANCE, WE DEVELOP A PROTOTYPE AND BENCHMARK BY APPLYING REAL-WORLD QF RESEARCH MODELS ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (NYSE) DATA. USING THIS PROTOTYPE, WE DEMONSTRATE THIS PLATFORM WITH AN APPLICATION TO: (I) DATA CLEANING AND AGGREGATING (INCLUDING THE COMPUTING OF LOGARITHMIC RETURNS FROM TICK DATA AND THE FINDING THE MEDIANS OF GROUPED DATA) AND (II) DATA MODELING: THE AUTOREGRESSIVE-MOVING AVERAGE (ARMA) MODEL. THE PERFORMANCE RESULTS SHOW THAT (A) THIS PLATFORM OBTAINS A HIGH THROUGHPUT (USUALLY IN THE ORDER OF MILLIONS OF TICK MESSAGES PER SECOND) AND A SUB-MICROSECOND LATENCY; (B) IT FULLY EXECUTES DATA-DEPENDENT TASKS THROUGH A DATA-DRIVEN EXECUTION; AND (C) IT IMPLEMENTS A MODULAR DESIGN APPROACH FOR RAPIDLY DEVELOPING THESE DATA-CRUNCHING METHODS AND QF RESEARCH MODELS. THIS PLATFORM RESULTING FROM AN AGGREGATED EFFORT OF THE DATA-DRIVEN EXECUTION AND BIG DATA INFRASTRUCTURE, OFFERS THE FINANCIAL ENGINEERS WITH NEW INSIGHTS AND ENHANCED CAPABILITIES FOR EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT INCORPORATION OF BIG DATA COMPLEX EVENT PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES IN THEIR WORKFLOW.","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK (SUNY) SYSTEM; SUNY COMMUNITY COLLEGE; STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK (SUNY) STONY BROOK; STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK (SUNY) SYSTEM; SUNY COMMUNITY COLLEGE; STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK (SUNY) STONY BROOK; NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY FARGO",NA,"PENG.ZHANG@STONYBROOK.EDU XIANG.SHI@STONYBROOK.EDU SAMEE.KHAN@NDSU.EDU","2022-12-01","JT9LA","10.1109/TBDATA.2018.2847629",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION","SAMEE U.

HOWEVER, DUE TO THE EXPLOSIVE GROWTH OF SENSING DATA, TRADITIONAL TIME SERIES ANALYSIS APPROACHES FAIL IN HANDLING LARGE-SCALE DATA WITH MISSING VALUES. TO THIS END, TWO AUTOREGRESSIVE (AR) BASED MATRIX FACTORIZATION (MF) METHODS ARE PRESENTED FOR MISSING SENSOR DATA IMPUTATION AND STRUCTURAL RESPONSE FORECASTING. THE FIRST MODEL INTEGRATES THE STANDARD MF FORMULATION WITH AN INNOVATIVE GRAPH-BASED TEMPORAL REGULARIZER, WHICH CAN EFFECTIVELY MODEL THE NONLINEAR DYNAMICS OF SHM DATA AND IS COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT, WHILE THE SECOND APPROACH INTRODUCES AN ADDITIONAL AR BASED MATRIX TO BETTER SIMULATE THE TEMPORAL FACTOR THANKS TO ITS CAPABILITY OF LEARNING THE DETAILS OF TEMPORAL EVOLUTION. FINALLY, THE PROPOSED METHODS ARE EVALUATED BY USING A FIELD-RECORDED SHM DATASET OF A MUNICIPAL CONCRETE BRIDGE, CONSIDERING VARIOUS MISSING SCENARIOS (I.E., RANDOM, STRUCTURED AND MIXED). THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE OF THE METHODS WHICH ACCURATELY RECOVER MISSING ENTRIES IN THE TIME SERIES AND FORECAST FUTURE RESPONSE. ADDITIONALLY, THE PARAMETRIC ANALYSIS ON MODEL PARAMETERS INDICATES THAT REASONABLY HIGHER RANK AND LONGER TIME LAG IMPROVE THE ESTIMATION ACCURACY WHILE SAVING COMPUTATIONAL COST.","24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND","CHANG'AN UNIVERSITY; NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY; NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY; RENMIN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA","108718","YANG1.LIU@NORTHEASTERN.EDU HAOSUN@RUC.EDU.CN","2022-12-01","0J1XW","10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108718",NA,"1096-1216",NA,NA,"CHANGAN UNIVERSITY SHORT-TERM STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM FOR POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS; BEIJING OUTSTANDING YOUNG SCIENTIST PROGRAM [BJJWZYJH012019100020098]; INTELLIGENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE PLATFORM, MAJOR INNOVATION \& PLANNING INTERDISCIPLINARY PLATFORM FOR THE DOUBLE-FIRST CLASSINITIATIVE, RENMIN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA","THE FIRST AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE SUPPORT FROM CHANGAN UNIVERSITY SHORT-TERM STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM FOR POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS.

COMPARED TO THE EXPLOSIVE RESEARCH ON TWO-DIMENSIONAL (2D) VDW MATERIALS, QUASI-ONE-DIMENSIONAL (QUASI-1D) VDW CRYSTALS HAVE RECEIVED CONSIDERABLY LESS ATTENTION, WHILE THEY ALSO PRESENT RICH PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING IMPLICATIONS. HERE WE REPORT ON THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF EXFOLIATED QUASI-1D TA2PD3SE8 VDW NANO WIRES. INTERESTINGLY, EVEN THOUGH THE INTERATOMIC INTERACTIONS ALONG EACH MOLECULAR CHAIN ARE MUCH STRONGER THAN THE INTERCHAIN VDW INTERACTIONS, THE MEASURED THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY STILL DEMONSTRATES A CLEAR DEPENDENCE ON THE CROSS-SECTIONAL SIZE UP TO >110 NM. THE RESULTS ALSO REVEAL THAT PARTIAL BALLISTIC PHONON TRANSPORT CAN PERSIST OVER 13 MU M AT ROOM TEMPERATURE ALONG THE MOLECULAR CHAIN DIRECTION, THE LONGEST EXPERIMENTALLY OBSERVED BALLISTIC TRANSPORT DISTANCE WITH OBSERVABLE EFFECTS ON THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY SO FAR. FIRST PRINCIPLES CALCULATIONS SUGGEST THAT THE ULTRALONG BALLISTIC PHONON TRANSPORT ARISES FROM THE HIGHLY FOCUSED LONGITUDINAL PHONONS PROPAGATING ALONG THE MOLECULAR CHAINS. THESE DATA HELP TO UNDERSTAND PHONON TRANSPORT THROUGH QUASI-1D VDW CRYSTALS, FACILITATING VARIOUS APPLICATIONS OF THIS CLASS OF MATERIALS.","1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY; SOUTHEAST UNIVERSITY - CHINA; SOUTHEAST UNIVERSITY - CHINA; TULANE UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA; UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHARLOTTE",NA,"ZMAO@TULANE.EDU DEYU.LI@VANDERBILT.EDU","2022-12-01","GB3QN","10.1021/acsnano.7b08718",NA,"1936-086X",NA,NA,"U.S. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [DMR-1308550, DMR-1308509, CBET-1403456, DMR-1532107]; NAVAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION CONSORTIUM (NEEC) PROGRAM [N00174-16-C-0008]; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY [DE-SC0014208]; LOUISIANA BOARD OF REGENTS UNDER GRANT LEQSF [(2015-18)-RD-A-23]; FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITIES; INNOVATIVE PROJECT FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS OF JIANGSU PROVINCE [KYLX15\_0058]; NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [51435003]; DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL \& PHYSICAL SCIEN [1308550, 1308509] FUNDING SOURCE: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION; DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING [1462866] FUNDING SOURCE: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION","THE AUTHORS THANK THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE U.S. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (DMR-1308550, DMR-1308509, CBET-1403456, DMR-1532107), AS WELL AS THE NAVAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION CONSORTIUM (NEEC) PROGRAM (CONTRACT\#: N00174-16-C-0008).

THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM FOR SEQUENCE CLUSTERING BASED ON DYNAMIC K-MEANS. SPECIFICALLY, THE CLUSTERING PROBLEM IS FIRSTLY FORMULATED RIGOROUSLY TO AN OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM, WHICH IS THEN SOLVED BY A PROPOSED THREE-STEP ALTERNATING-DIRECTION OPTIMIZATION APPROACH. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS SUCCESSFULLY ILLUSTRATED THROUGH THREE EXAMPLES WITH BOTH SYNTHETIC DATA SETS AND FIELD GROUND-MOTION MEASUREMENTS. IN PARTICULAR, THIS APPROACH IS APPLIED TO GROUND-MOTION CLUSTERING/SELECTION AND SHOWS SATISFACTORY RESULTS.
